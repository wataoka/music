Now listen ya'll, what you waitin' for is the Noizy Tribe

ふりほどきたくて 外す胸の安全装置(セーフティー)
ゆれる想いをつかまえて そうkissをして
そういつもプレッシャー ぎゅうぎゅうに揺られた電車
よどんだ目した人ゴミから みてろぜってーいつか ほら電光石火
飛び出しあのチェッカーフラッグ手に入れる そう信じて
抱きたい夢がみえるでしょう この腕に感じたいyour soul
This moment I can feel 前兆到来を知る
このままいくぜI'm the Noizy Tribe

Come with me, come and cry with me
Got to be, got to be, now you got to be free
Noizy tribe, you're my noizy tribe
You can feel, you can feel, you can feel in my love
Come with me, come and cry with me
Got to be, got to be, now you got to be free
Noizy tribe, you're my noizy tribe
You can break, you can break you can break coz you're Noizy tribe

Boom! Noisy Tribeにオマカセ 体中アドレナリン騒がせ
磨くぜ現場のド真ん中で 美しさの究極形 Noizy Tribe

Bring the beat back, ride on ride on

ジリジリ 街に吹いた砂まじり 風 かじかんだ手にぎりしめ歯ぎしり
どんな状況でもヘコまねえ いつもハッキリと見えていた最終形
あきるほどに響かせて アナタだけに宿るリフレイン
I feel this everyday ずっと上見て ブレない視線coz I'm noizy tribe

Come with me, come and cry with me
Got to be, got to be, now you got to be free
Noizy tribe, you're my noizy tribe
You can feel, you can feel, you can feel in my love
Come with me, come and cry with me
Got to be, got to be, now you got to be free
Noizy tribe, you're my noizy tribe
You can break, you can break you can break coz you're Noizy tribe


OK OK OKおまたせ 暴れん坊達のワンダーランド はちきれそう
それぞれの熟望ひっさげ集まろう ノイズの中
伝え合う想いはプレシャスソウル

This moment I can feel 前兆到来を知る
このままいくぜI'm the Noizy Tribe

Come with me, come and cry with me
Got to be, got to be, now you got to be free
Noizy tribe, you're my noizy tribe
You can feel, you can feel, you can feel in my love
Come with me, come and cry with me
Got to be, got to be, now you got to be free
Noizy tribe, you're my noizy tribe
You can break, you can break you can break coz you're Noizy tribe

Here come the Noizy Tribe, we're back, wicked

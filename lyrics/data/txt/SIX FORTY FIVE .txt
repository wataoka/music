Now it's 6:45
I'll be your new neighbourhood
You lay there in an ice cold sweat
I'm on the last sequence so
Put your hands up in the air
All my people in this place
I'll be comin' soon get it out of you
Lets get it on now

Lookin' down a crowded town
I'm flying like a plane
Inject it all and end it all
Just Throw yo hands up
Lookin' down a crowded town
I'm flying like a plane
Inject it all and end it all
Just Throw yo hands up

Just Throw yo hands up
What is it you want
Just Throw yo hands up

Looking through the eyes at you
Walking down the streets
Bail you out and gotta get out now
Get up and stand up
Lookin' thruuu the eyes you
Walking down the streets
Bail you out and Gotta get out now
Get up and stand up

Get up and stand up
Let it all hang out
Get up and stand up

All you ever looked for
you ever wanted
Roots of your big fear

All I ever needed
I ever hated
Commin together

All you ever looked for
you ever wanted
Roots of your big fear

All I ever needed
I ever hated
Commin together

That's the way it always ends
We're gonna be perfect
Do you wanna pay for your tears
I'm gonna do it all over
Get yourself in once again
You're the one who's creating toys
I'll be satisfied and electrified
You're overloaded

Put yourself in my place
Runnin' across your minds
It's outta space It's outta sight
Just Clear yo mind out
Put yourself in my place
Runnin' across your minds
It's outta space It's outta sight
Just Clear yo mind out

Just Clear yo mind out
Just Get together
Just Clear yo mind out

All you ever looked for
you ever wanted
Roots of your big fear

All I ever needed
I ever hated
Commin together

All you ever looked for
you ever wanted
Roots of your big fear

All I ever needed
I ever hated
Commin together

All I want is you to
Ease my mind
Say everything's all right

All you have to be
You have to be is
what I've made you

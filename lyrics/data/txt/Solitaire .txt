But you were born in this world wiht no love
But you're not only
To be let go
Everyday we fight against the night
Everyday we fight against the night

Please don't close your eyes
You gotta let you know your feeling
You gotta let you know your bleeding
You gotta never hide out anymore

Please don't close your eyes
You gotta let you know your feeling
You gotta let you know your beating
You gotta give your heart out evermore

But you were born in this world so alone
But you're not only
To be let go
Everyday we fight against the night
Everyday we fight against the night

Please don't close your eyes
You gotta let you know your feeling
You gotta let you know your bleeding
You gotta never hide out anymore

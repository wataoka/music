Can't you see the light
Can't you feel the vibe
Can't you see the light
Can't you feel the vibe

We can step it up, keep it up, lift it up
We can pick it up, get it up, do it right
We can step it up, keep it up, lift it up
We can pick it up, get it up, do it right

Memories of yesterday
There's no place to hide
W/Z a high heel shoes
Wearin' trip hop clothes
She's comin' in a free style

Take you're time don't move to fast
Ya smile, Ya style, She's so fine
Tryin' for so long
and still don't understand

W/Z her beautiful straight hair
In this world w/z on luch
She was a little bit too young
But She's dancin' better than anyone

I know this is somethin' new
Just guide me through
Every hour she fights the power
W/Z a dope hat playin' tricks

She plays game w/z on rule
Can't control... Happenin'almost evertime
Goin' out to parties
W/Z a gay man on her side

Feel so good inside and
There is no need to lie
The minute she blinked her eyes
bad feeling will die

She can't even look
W/Zout  being watched
But it's OK! It's enough
to satisfy her life

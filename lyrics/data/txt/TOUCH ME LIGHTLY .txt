With you in my heart
There're no words left to say
For you take my breath a way
Falling deep down in your eyes
All the time may just slip by, slip by

Touch me lightly
Easy on the heart
This night's to last
Drift me down gently
Easy on your heart
Don't let this moment pass

You are what I risk
Where there's no final kiss
For the gambler in us all
Lost inside of you
Love that burns me through

No more one night stands
Tightly take me hand
Dream me what seems to be
For there's no more to ask
Then for what we have to last

Touch me lightly
Easy on the heart
This night's to last
Drift me down gently
Easy on your heart
Don't let this moment pass

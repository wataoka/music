Sweetest sweetest
I can feel it
Left in pieces
Do me suck it

And why do I do this to me
And why do you fall behind me

Billy! Twist me around, Billy
Believe turn me, psycho Billy

Don't melt away now I wanna play Disco Disco
Don't need away to hell with the way Disco Disco, Beret!

死神 空間 来る絵、そうさ Disco
飼い主 淫乱 唾液 Lowlight Disco, Beret!

And why do I do this for me
And why do I fall behind me

Billy! Twist me around, Billy
Believe turn me, psycho Billy

Don't melt away now I wanna play Disco Disco
Don't need away to hell with the way Disco Disco
Don't melt away now I wanna play Disco Disco
Don't need away to hell with the way Disco Disco, Beret!

Moon river
Wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style
Some day
Old dream maker
You heart beraker
Wherever you're goin'
I'm goin' your way

Two drifters
Off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting round the bend
My Huckleberry friend
Moon river and me

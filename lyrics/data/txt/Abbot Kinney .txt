Before you go I've got to tell you something
Hey, shall we stop this hide and seek
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
I realize, your loving eyes, I picturize
You must believe in this magic
You and I, we should know each other better
No need to hide this feeling
No more days to be alone, so long

Never say goodbye again
I'll never let you go away
Do you feel the same way as I do?
I'm just wondering
Baby, feel it, anyway

I feel fine walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street
Art-street where I'd like to be
'till the sky grows dark
And if you want it
Close to me, baby
Walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street

You know, just as well as me
So fine, you melody the poetry
As the sky goes blue
And if you want it
Close to me, baby
Walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street

Let me tell you all about love
It's not so easy to live alone, hey you
We must believe in this magic
You and I, we should grow each and everyday
No need to hide this feeling
Wanna love you more, for so long

Never say goodbye again
I'll never let you go away
Won't you be my darling, will you?
I'm just wondering
Baby, feel it, anyway

I feel fine walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street
White sea, where we used to be
'till the sun goes down
And if you want it
Next to me, baby
Walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street

I know, It fits me perfectly
So fine, we comedy the memory
As the sky goes red
And if you want it
Next to me, baby
Walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street

I woke up this morning
The rain let up a little bit
I was going to call you
But I hung back for a moment
Then I thought twice
I went out to see you in a minute
Why did I?
Just wondering
Baby, love you, anyway

I feel fine, walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street
Art-street where I'd like to be
'till the sky grows dark
And if you want it
Close to me, baby
Walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street

You know, just as well as me
So fine, you melody the poetry
As the sky goes blue
And if you want it
Come on, baby
I wanna be close to your mind

Alright, walkin' under the palm tree
So fine, coffee and pastry
As the sky goes red
And if you want it
Next to me, baby
Take a stroll along this street

So fine,
Walkin' on Abbot Kinney Street

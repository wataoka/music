You take me back and show me you're
the only one
Reveal the way you got me, I've got to run
You're still alive
I'm never gonna take your feeling which is
complicated

踏まれてねじられここまで
歩んだこの道の先は
誰にも踏み込まれたくはない 未開拓地領域

触れられてしまえば Break me up
整えりゃ Wait for a moment
ここらでさぁ Falling out yeah
ギリギリで Runs out of time

I can't believe in you
I'd see you another day another way
Nobody's standing near
There are something you can't see or feel, baby
自己のエゴ虚しく 行く末 Yeah I'm sorry
履き違えはなはだしくてもう doubt
行き違い out there?

I keep trying to reach you with my broken legs
How many times have you seen me when I fall?
But now I know you're not the only thing like before
Not the one I need to share
くだらない 意味もない くそ食らえ
それぐらい 分かるよ バカじゃない
I never give myself to you any more

I can't believe in you
I'd see you another day another way
Nobody's standing near
There are something you can't see or feel, baby
自己暗示虚しく 気付けば Oh when I'm me
履き違えはなはだしくてもう doubt
行き違い out there?

I can't believe in you
I'd see you another day another way
Nobody's standing near
There are something you can't see or feel, baby
自己暗示虚しく 気付けば Oh when I'm me
履き違えはなはだしくてもう doubt
行き違い out there?

I can't believe in you
羅列した無数の選択はNo!!
勝ち誇りバカばかりでじゃもう doubt
行き違い out there

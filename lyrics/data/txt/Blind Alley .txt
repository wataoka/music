陰りゆく真白き部屋を
青黒く空白が染める
No way out! 逃れられない
There's no doubt! わかってるはずさ

現実が剥き出しのこの傷を舐める
落日は揺るぎなく今日もpitch black
Won't you set me free

As long as you are there
I know I'll never break your spell
No more

真実は燃え上がり、この俺を笑う
静寂はとめどなく、今もjet black
Won't you set me free
Set me free!

As long as you are there
I know I'll never break your spell
No more
In this blinded alley
I know I'll never break your spell
No more

Won't you set me free
Take me out from here

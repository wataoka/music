I turn around and there you are
you seem so close but very far away
I cannot find the words I want to say
but only want to hold you just to only hold you
to me it seems just like a dream
I thought that you had lost your love for me
my prayers were answered bringing you to me
never let me go never let me go forever

So stay with me stay with me
and never let me go
just take me in your arms again
and say you love me so

So stay with me stay with me
and never let me go
Just say the words I want to hear
oh baby please don't go

I turn around and there you are
You seem so close but very far away
I cannot find the wards I want to say
never let me go never let me go forever

※So stay with me stay with me
　and never let me go
　Just take me in your arms again
　and say you love me so
　So stay with me stay with me
　and never let me go
　Just say the words I want to hear
　oh baby please don't go

※Repeat

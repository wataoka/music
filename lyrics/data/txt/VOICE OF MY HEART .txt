Like the wind
That whispers through the trees
There's a song
You taught my heart to sing
Now the voice
That echoes through my dreams
Says you are the one
The only one for me

All alone
The silence was so loud
On my own
I never would have heard a sound
So sweet and clear
The melody that I hear
When you are around
(When you are around)
It's the voice of my heart
As it sings in the dark, my love
When I am holding you
With the voice of my heart
I promise you from the start
I'll give to you
A love that's true
Listen to my heart Yeah…

Everytime
You look at me that way
And your eyes
Say more than words could say
I can feel
The love you feel for me
Darling, now I know
Our love was meant to be

All this time
I was too shy to say, yeah
All the things
This heart of mine will gladly say
For when you're near
The melody that I hear
Takes my breath away

It's the voice of my heart
As it sings in the dark, my love
When I am holding you
With the voice of my heart
I promise you from the start
I'll give to you
A love that's true
Listen to my heart
(Uh… Yeah… Yeah)

Now that we're together
We know love will last forever
Let us raise our voices
And sing another chorus

It's the voice of my heart
As it sings in the dark, my love
When I am holding you
With the voice of my heart
I promise we'll never part
I'll give to you
A love that's true
Listen to my heart

With the voice of my heart
I promise we'll never part
I'll give to you
A love that's true
Listen to my heart
Oh Listen Listen…

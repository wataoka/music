They'll soon be here...

In here you're safe
Don't tell me about the cherry days(They feed on what you got)
Don't tell me about the conversations(They feed on what you got)
More than I could ever use to make them go

Take a sip of my bluest ocean
That's how I'm gonna fix you up yeah
You don't need to hear that song again
So dive in and hide from all your demons
They're coming soon to try and take you back
You don't need to keep that heartache in you
Just pass you sickness onto me

And I swear that I'll get it out of me
Yeah I swear, it won't nest inside of me

And I'll stay here above the ocean
That heals you up as it brings you back
As I stay here and guard the ocean
My heart beats inside of you

They're coming over the walls
They're coming over the walls
And if it's real, I'll make it surreal and tear out all of their claws
So they can never hurt you anymore

Slowly sink in my bluest ocean
You can breathe and still be safe there
Stay under untill the coast is clear
You're crazy, all your life you've been aching on a broken heart
You don't have to keep holding on
Just pass it on to me

And I swear that I'll get it out of me
And I swear, it won't make me stray from you

And I'll stay here above the ocean
That heals you up as it brings you back
As I stay here and guard the ocean
My heart bearts inside for two

They're coming over the walls
They're coming over the walls
And if it's real, I'll make it surreal and tear out all of their claws

In here you're safe
But don't tell me about the cherry days(They feed on what you got)
Don't tell me about the conversations(They feed on what you got)
More than I could ever use to make them go

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to the sea
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me

Gone my lover's dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here
To wheep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind say that love has sinned
Left my heart breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me crying and sighing all alone

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep, weep for me

Whisper to the wind say that love has sinned
Left my heart breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me crying and sighing all alone

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me

Because I'm so sad, so sad, so sad, so so sad...

Sail away with me
Far across the sea
In the name of love-in the name-in the name of love
Follow the stars in the heavens above
We can be free
Down to the sea
We can be free

So take my hand
And feel our blessing
We are the stardust
Angels who dream or dream up sailing
When we are free
To find a blessing, a blessing of love

Listen to the bells
Ringing in the square
Calling us to live-and to give in the name of love
As all of our tears turn the rain into dust
Filling our hearts
Healing our souls
Making us whole

So take my hand
And feel our blessing
We are the stardust
Angels who dream or dream up sailing
When we are free
To find a blessing, a blessing of love

Two hearts travel 'cross the universe
Through the darkest heart of midnight
How can I live without the hope that we
Might touch the edge of heaven's light

So take my hand
And feel our blessing
We are the only ones who
Know our way back home
We've sailed so far away
Still I know we'll be home someday
If we follow our hearts and our souls
We can find our blessing of love

Blessing of love
Blessing of love
Blessing of love

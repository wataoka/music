左も右にも 媚びた顔したPlastic Girls
Is this dream?
Is this real?
Give me some time

Don't forget 大切なもの
Keep on moving 真っすぐ
Be yourself that nobody can't be
Show me who you are

Hey you, Pretty Girl
I can get you anything you want
If you be mine
Here comes dirty old man who got money
I can't believe that you go with him

The Plastic Girls
見せ掛けの毎日に
満たされたフリをして
本当の自分
見失わないで
Trying hard to make him happy
So that he can be your daddy
You can be a Rich
But do you love him ?
作り笑いの日々
最後に何が残るの
Don't waste your time

Oh Ms. Plastic Girl
I hope you'll find a way
At least you'll find a guy with real love
You are playing game
You seem to be winning
You're losing it

The Plastic Girls
とびきりの笑顔で
誰もがふりかえる
だけどそれはただの
見せ掛けだけで
心の底で 泣いているPlastic Girl
本当の笑顔も 忘れた
それでも続く毎日がある
It's not too late
Wake up, Plastic Girl

Oh Ms. Plastic Girl
I hope you'll find a way
At least you'll find a guy with real love
You are playing game
You seem to be winning
You're losing it

The Plastic Girls
とびきりの笑顔で
誰もがふりかえる
だけどそれはただの
見せ掛けだけで
心の底で 泣いているPlastic Girl
本当の笑顔も 忘れた
それでも続く毎日がある
It's not too late
Wake up, Plastic Girl

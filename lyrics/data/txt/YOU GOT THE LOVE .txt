Love me right what's the matter with you
Hold me tight why must I tell you what to do
Smilin', smilin' comes as no surprise
Smile ain't hidin' what I see in your eyes

The story goes much deeper than the eye can see yes it do
Stop runnin' a game I can tell you're avoiding me

Oh ain't nothin' I wouldn't pay
Just to hear, hear you say
I love you, I need you

Love me right what's the matter with you
Hold me tight why must I tell you what to do
Smilin', smilin' comes as no surprise
Smile ain't hidin' what I see in your eyes

You got the love gimme the strength to keep on livin'
Whatever it is I can't do without what cha givin'

You got the love gimme the strength to keep on livin'
Whatever it is I can't do without what cha givin'

You got the love !

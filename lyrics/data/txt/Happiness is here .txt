Happiness is here, here for yourself
Happiness is here, here for myself
Happiness is here, here for yourself
Happiness is here, here for myself

I want a dream where everything seems so real
I want a dream where everything seems so real

Happiness is here, here for yourself
Happiness is here, here for myself
Happiness is here, here for yourself
Happiness is here, here for myself

I want a dream where everything seems so real
We live in extremes and drive in between the chill

And if you're ever around
And if you're ever around
And if you're ever around

Happiness is here, here for yourself
Happiness is here, here for myself
Happiness is here, here for yourself
Happiness is here, here for myself

You'll be found

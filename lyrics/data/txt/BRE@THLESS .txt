Share me your madness that you keep in
Show that you're scared like me
Thus we are teens
Wash my hands of that for this?
Sell myself for this hopeless loop
May I have seen your face somewhere sometime?
You freeze my blood and spine
So freak me out
Like a look in a mirror
Face my Doppelgänger
How 'bout you? Aren't you?

Beware of attentions, entourages and mates
You are what you do
Depress your mentions, ain't got to be a bighead
You are what you fool

Right now
Burn your soul, neck or nothing
Burn it out 'til you're losing your reason
Forget the stoned reason to drive it
Just to scribe your existence
Not a crime, your insistence
Die another day
So do I
Burn my soul, all to nothing
Burn it out, let me charge in your advance
I'm watching for the chance to beat it
Even though my body's shaking
I'll give it all, deadly bumping
Cuz you make me feel
Breathless

Share me your sadness that you keep in
Know that you're played around
Thus we are green
Kind of harsh misfortune ran
So-called Yin and Yang among us
Are you really serious to save her right now?
Get ready to give your life, willing or not
Have the real foresight a few
Unwanted déjà vu
All 'bout you, warn you

Beware of attentions, entourages and mates
You are what you do
Depress your mentions, ain't got to be a bighead
You are what you fool

Right now
Burn your soul, neck or nothing
Burn it out 'til you're losing your reason
Forget the stoned reason to drive it
Just to scribe your existence
Not a crime, your insistence
Die another day
So do I
Burn my soul, all to nothing
Burn it out, let me charge in your advance
I'm watching for the chance to beat it
Even though my body's shaking
I'll give it all, deadly bumping
Cuz you make me feel
Breathless

Right now
Burn your soul, neck or nothing
Burn it out 'til you're losing your reason
Forget the stoned reason to drive it
Just to scribe your existence
Not a crime, your insistence
Die another day
So do I
Burn my soul, all to nothing
Burn it out, let me charge in your advance
I'm watching for the chance to beat it
Even though my body's shaking
I'll give it all, deadly bumping
Cuz you make me feel
Breathless

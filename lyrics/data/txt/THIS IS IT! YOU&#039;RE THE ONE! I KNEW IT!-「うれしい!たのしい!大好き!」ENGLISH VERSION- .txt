MY LOVE FOR YOU
COULD IT BE DEJA VU?
COS I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE
WHEN I SEE YOU SMILE
I CAN HEAR MY INNER CHILD
WHISPER TO ME"LOOK NO MORE"

I HOLD MY HEAD UP HIGH
AND I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES
OH I DON'T WANNA HIDE THIS FEELING INSIDE
I'LL NEVER LET YOU DOWN
I'LL ALWAYS BE AROUND
SEE! I ALWAYS KNEW THAT I WAS MEANT TO BE WITH YOU

THIS IS IT! YOU'RE THE ONE!
I KNEW IT! ALL ALONG
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! I CAN FEEL IT IN MY SOUL
THIS IS IT! YOU AND ME
WE WERE JUST MEANT TO BE
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

MY LOVE FOR YOU
IS SOMETHING REAL SOMETHING NEW
BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE A WORD I SAY
BUT I KNOW IT'S TRUE
EVERYTIME I LOOK AT YOU
AND EVERYTIME YOU LOOK AT ME THAT WAY

THE PROOF YOU CAN NOT MISS
YOU FEEL IT WHEN KISS
SO BABY DON'T DENY THIS FEELING INSIDE
IT'S MORE THAN JUST A CRUSH
IT'S MORE THAN JUST A RUSH
LIKE I'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE THIS MIGHT BE MORE THAN LOVE

THIS IS IT! YOU'RE THE ONE!
I KNEW IT! ALL ALONG
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! I CAN FEEL IT IN MY SOUL
THIS IS IT! YOU AND ME
WE WERE JUST MEANT TO BE
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

I THINK THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HELD MY HAND YOU KNEW IT
I THINK THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU KISSED ME YOU FELT THE WAY THAT
I DID
ADMIT IT!

THIS IS IT! YOU'RE THE ONE!
I KNEW IT! ALL ALONG
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! I CAN FEEL IT IN MY SOUL
THIS IS IT! YOU AND ME
WE WERE JUST MEANT TO BE
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

YES YOU'RE IT! YOU'RE THE ONE!
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BEGUN
I KNOW YOU FEEL IT LIKE! FEEL IT IN MY SOUL
THIS IS IT! YOU AND ME
WE WERE JUST MEANT TO BE
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

YES, YOU'RE IT! I KNEW IT!
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BEGUN
YOU'RE THE ONE TELLING ME"LOOK NO MORE"
THIS IS IT! YOU'RE THE ONE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
YOU AND ME, MEANT TO BE... BE AS ONE!

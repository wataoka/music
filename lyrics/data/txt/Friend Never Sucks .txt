Tell me why
The reason for you are here alone
Take my hand and step your feet
So stand by me

I'll say you're my friend
Don't be ashamed to shake hands
Let's come my home
And the party starts from now
I hope you're doing well

Who you are? We don't care
We are not alone
Say your name and shake my hand
Stay here with me

I'll say you're my friend
Don't be ashamed to shake hands
Let's come my home
And the party starts from now
I hope you're doing well

What they say? We don't fuckin' care
It's ok, never mind
Make some noise and circle pit
Now we're all friends

I'll say you're my friend
Don't be ashamed to shake hands
Let's come my home
And the party starts from now
I hope you're doing well

Tell me why
The reason for you are here alone
Take my hand and step your feet
So stand by me

I'll say you're my friend
Don't be ashamed to shake hands
Let's come my home
And the party starts from now
I hope you're doing well

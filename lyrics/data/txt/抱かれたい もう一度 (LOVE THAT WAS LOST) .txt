I had a dream you left my life 
It was a nightmare I don't care for 
Then I awoke and saw you there 
There was no need for all these tears 
There's no reason to cry 

A love so strong cannot die 
Happiness is all around 
Cause love that was lost is now found 

Before I found you all I could see 
A world without love cold ãƒ¼ no sympathy 
You are special so special to me 
Finding your love cured the misery 
There's no reason to cry 

A love so strong cannot die 
Happiness is all around 
Cause love that was lost is now found 
Happiness is all around 
Cause love that was lost is now found

Nothing I say comes out right
I can't love without a fight
No one ever knows my name
When I pray for sun, it rains
I'm so sick of wasting time
But nothings moving in my mind
Inspiration can't be found
I get up and fall but

I'm ALIVE!, I'm ALIVE! oh yeah
Between the good and bad's
You'll find me
Reaching for heaven
I will fight
And I'll sleep when I die
I'll live my life cause I'm ALIVE!

Every lover breaks my heart
And I how it from the start
Still I end up in a mess
Every time I second guess
all my friends just run away
when I'm having a bad day
I would rather stay in bed but I know there's a reason

I'm ALIVE!, I'm ALIVE! oh yeah
Between the good and bad's
You'll find me
Reaching for heaven
I will fight
And I'll sleep when I die
I'll live my life cause I'm ALIVE!

When I'm bored to death at home
When he won't pick up the phone
When I'm stuck in second place
Those regrets I can't erase
Only I can change the end
Of the movie in my head
There's no time for misery
I won't feel sorry for me

I'm ALIVE!, I'm ALIVE! oh yeah
Between the good and bad's
You'll find me
Reaching for heaven
I will fight
And I'll sleep when I die
I'll live my life cause I'm ALIVE!

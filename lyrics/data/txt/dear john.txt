days of night slip through my mind in a slient moonless sky
paralyzed and motionless
all things falter
somewhere back
I lost myself so far deep inside of you
everything's become too much
so deep
so weak
where did I go?
images of falling light move across the hollow sky
I see movement after all
calling, falling
remenber you're not the only one to fell this way
cause I'm one who has also had enough
so long dear John
I'm gonna go

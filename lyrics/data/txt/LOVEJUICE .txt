Don't know where you're from
Never seen you around
But that don't mean nothing to me
Just want a taste of that...

She stood there waiting alone
Green eyes her shoulder exposed
Smiling and biting her straw
She gave me one look, I froze

Her sexy inviting eyes
My hands on her hips as we grind
She whispered in an accent unknown

“Just let go, let the music take control babe
Move your body, nothing crazy
So take it slow, there's so many things I want you to know
I ain't leaving you, cuz I'm yours tonight”

I can tell you want me too
And every time I think of you
That luscious drink your lips produce
I can taste that sweet LOVEJUICE
(×2)

“Oh”,“Oh”, “More”,“Slow”

Classy like none of these hoes
Pretty little frame under her clothes
Those lips as red as a rose
Vibing to the beat from the Boze

Don't rush the night is still young
Take it to the room and sex things up
I can see you call out my name, saying

“Don't stop, more,” I'm trying to see how your lips feel babe
All we need is body language
And now I know, I'm falling for you and I just can't lie
I won't go nowhere cuz I'm your man tonight

I can tell you want me too
And every time I think of you
That luscious drink your lips produce
I can taste that sweet LOVEJUICE
(×2)

See, I've been all around the world, but I ain't (seen nothing×2)
Like you, don't matter where you're from, it don't (mean nothing×2)
See, I've been all around the world, but I ain't (seen nothing×2)
And now I got four minutes to take you back, girl we can
(be something×2)

I can tell you want me too
And every time I think of you
That luscious drink your lips produce
I can taste that sweet LOVEJUICE
(×2)

I can tell you want me too
And every time I think of you
That luscious drink your lips produce
I can taste that sweet LOVEJUICE
(×2)

I can tell you want me too
And every time I think of you
That luscious drink your lips produce
I can taste that sweet LOVEJUICE
(×2)

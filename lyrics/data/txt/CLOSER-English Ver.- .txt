All that is near us
We must know
Could disappear any day
Be careful

The main key to finding happiness
Lies nowhere else but in my soul

You could reminisce you could recall
The very last time you felt joy
Or maybe you are so blessed to a point
Where you can't remember anything

It's a harmony
A miracle
Being able to breathe and live at all
So here is your one and only chance

Life is an opportunity

All that is near us
We must know
Could disappear any day
Be careful

The main key to finding happiness
Lies nowhere else but in my soul

You know the closer you get to something
The tougher it is to see it
And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

People may call a kind deed
An act of mere hypocrisy
But never mind those who have lost faith
You shouldn't give in to what they say

As a matter of fact let me tell you
Even if it was for a selfish cause
A salvageable hypocrisy
Is superior to murderous honesty

Everybody tells you from time to time
To never give up like a phrase from a movie
They tell you to stand up for yourself
As if was always that easy

Gather a handful of courage in my heart
To go on and survive another day
And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

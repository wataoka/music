Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
once in a while,
Please promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said
Our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking, silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard to put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

We never said
Our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But please promise me
That sometimes
You will think...
Of me!

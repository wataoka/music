workin hard
nine to fivin' is all about the sweat
rikai dekinai
tell me how do you deal with that stress
getting paid
now do you ever have time to just do you
got it made
but when the money's gone
what you gonna do

stressing bout directions
but you never wanna wait on it
shopped for everything you wanted
got it and you hated it
makin yourself happy with material things
that makes you crazy

oh...oh
Lets go out tonight
So we can have a good time
Don't want you to be uptight
we can do anything u like
you need to
chill out and let go sometimes
feel free to let yourself say
kirakuni take it easy
throw your hands up if you feel me

slow it down
and turn the music up
come on its party time
start dancing and you'll smile
if you just
chill out and let go sometimes
feel free to let yourself say
kirakuni take it easy
ya troubles away

kick back relax
if wanna unwind
loosen up let your body decompress
tossin' turnin'
make you calm when you're feeling restless
leave all your problems
cause this party is your Oasis
now all you need is a tight fit
hot music
and a few friends with smiling faces

stressing bout directions
but you never wanna wait on it
shopped for everything you wanted
got it and you hated it
makin yourself happy with material things
that makes you crazy

oh...oh
Lets go out tonight
So we can have a good time
Don't want you to be uptight
we can do anything u like
you need to
chill out and let go sometimes
feel free to let yourself say
kirakuni take it easy
throw your hands up if you feel me

slow it down
and turn the music up
come on its party time
start dancing and you'll smile
if you just
chill out and let go sometimes
feel free to let yourself say
kirakuni take it easy
ya troubles away

You never know unless you try
To break out of the day to day grind
So tonight leave it all behind
When hear the music just get into it
Find out what it feels like to be free

stressing bout directions
but you never wanna wait on it
shopped for everything you wanted
got it and you hated it
makin yourself happy with material things
that makes you crazy

oh...oh
Lets go out tonight
So we can have a good time
Don't want you to be uptight
we can do anything u like
you need to
chill out and let go sometimes
feel free to let yourself say
kirakuni take it easy
throw your hands up if you feel me

slow it down
and turn the music up
come on its party time
start dancing and you'll smile
if you just
chill out and let go sometimes
feel free to let yourself say

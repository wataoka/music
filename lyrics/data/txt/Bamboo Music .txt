I walk through open fields
Where children sing
Bamboo music
A song for life itself
Play to win
In bamboo music

We work - working harder still
Down where life begins
From here to heaven
We fight - fighting harder still
Down where life begins
From here to heaven

Building bamboo houses by the million
Lighting fires that only burn inside
Singing bamboo music by the million
Fighting for our lives

I walk through open fields
Where children sing
Bamboo music
A glimpse of life itself
Of sun and steel
In bamboo music

We work - working harder still
Down where life begins
From here to heaven
We fight - fighting harder still
Down where life begins
From here to heaven

Building bamboo houses by the million
Lighting fires that only burn inside
Singing bamboo music by the million
Fighting for our lives

Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't

Everybody hands up high
嘘! まじこれ精一杯?
見つめて渾然一体
rock rock rock 止まらないで

そう、rhythm と melody
最高級の料理
感じて舞い踊れ
響かせてその声を

(YAYAYA) いい音楽? そうねまるで花の夢
(YAYAYA) ほら気をつけて、赤いバラには棘
(YAYAYA) でもいいの身をまかせて
(YAYAYA) そうここじゃ music and you

一期一会、夢が醒めたら
私たちはいない good night
So DJ 繋いで目眩く
いまなにもかも忘れさせて

Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't

Everybody hands up high
Are you ready? all
熱狂的にみんな
rock rock rock 飛び跳ねるんだ

はっちゃけちゃえば? はっちゃけて!
衝動的な一体感
はっちゃけちゃえば? はっちゃけて!
この club を弾け飛ばそう yeah!

(YAYAYA) いい音楽? そうねまるで花の夢
(YAYAYA) ほら気をつけて、赤いバラには棘
(YAYAYA) 刻む BPM あわせ clap your hands and step
(YAYAYA) そうここじゃ music and you

ひとつになる、その瞬間に
自分だけじゃないと知る
誰もが胸に憂い抱き
健気にいまを生きてること

Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't

いいの、朝が来ても
音楽は消えない
あなたの心、癒すように
永遠に続く this music makes me high

一期一会、夢が醒めたら
私たちはいない good night
So DJ 繋いで目眩く
いまなにもかも忘れさせて

Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't stop the music
Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't

Baby please
Don't turn around
I'm holding back my tears
The evening glow
A rustle of the winds
So close to you but so far
I've been keeping my eyes on you, all the time

My love is all for you...
My love is all for you...
Even if you turn me down, I'll be loving you
Maybe I'll have a broken heart
Again & again I'll try to reach you

Cuz I'm in love with you
Yes, I'm in love with you
I don't care the painful times & some sleepless night
Don't need to bask in the morning light
Again & again I'll try to reach you
My love is all for you...

Everytime, when I see your face
I get a new memory
Deeply sigh
Even a hesitation
The time is precious to me
I've been waiting for you so long... take me now

My love is all for you...
My love is all for you...
Even if you turn me down, I'll be loving you
Maybe I'll have a broken heart
Again & again I'll try to reach you

Cuz I'm in love with you
Yes, I'm in love with you
I don't care the painful times & some sleepless night
Don't need to bask in the morning light
Again & again I'll try to reach you
My love is all for you...

My love is all for you...
My love is all for you...
Even if you turn me down, I'll be loving you
Maybe I'll have a broken heart
Again & again I'll try to reach you

Cuz I'm in love with you
Yes, I'm in love with you
I don't care the painful times & some sleepless night
Don't need to bask in the morning light
Again & again I'll try to reach you
My love is all for you...

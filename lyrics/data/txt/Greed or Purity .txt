Keep the silence
Now turn the lights down for me
Listen to my words of fear

I have paid for
All my abusive sins now
Why do I still run?
Where do I go?

Nothing else to do
But to live a life full of lies
Might be hell or bloody fun

One thing left to do
If I'm strong enough to keep up
Greed or purity?
The time of truth has come
Now say your prayers

I'm not afraid of
How GOD will judge me later
Listen to my words of fear

Lavish cars and
Curvy girls are great but
Solitude remains
It doesn't change

I have never sought for loneliness
I have never sought for tenderness
To see things I've never seen

I'm alone in the world that I don't seem fit for
And maybe... 'cause lately... I can't be sure...

I don't know what to do, and where to go
So I'm a leaf
I've waited and waited for something to catch so long
But I know that I will make it
I'm into the sun
Like a five-eighths beat...
Dreaming is singing of the mind

I don't know what to do, and where to go
So I'm a leaf
I've waited and waited for something to catch so long
But I know that I will make it
I'm into the sun
Like a five-eighths beat...
Dreaming is singing of the mind

I don't know what to do, and where to go
So I'm a leaf
I've waited and waited for something to catch so long
But I know that I will make it
I'm into the sun
Like a five-eighths beat...
Dreaming is singing of the mind

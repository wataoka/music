Bombard assault attack
Go hard
Yea, I like it like that
You scared don't be
I won't bite
Unless that's what you like

Backed up in a corner
Hands up I surrender
Mind games 'til I holla OH OH OH OH!!
Hook line ship is sinking
Go head dig ya teeth in
'Til they hear me screaming OH OH OH!!

Beat it like a drum
Boy, put your hands on me!!
OH OH OH OH OH!!
Put your hands on me

Allure appeal entice
Go hard
Now you know what I like
The crowd they see
Let them see
Enough isn't enough for me

Backed up in a corner
Hands up I surrender
Mind games 'til I holla OH OH OH!!

Beat it like a drum
Boy, put your hands on me!!
OH OH OH OH OH!!
Put your hands on me

And when the lights come up in here
We can't stop the way we feel
We keep on going
Until the night is over
Boy, we keep on going
Never over

Beat it like a drum
Boy, put your hands on me!!
OH OH OH OH OH!!
Put your hands on me

Beat it like a drum

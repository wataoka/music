going insane I'm not afraid
if my death makes it better
then I cut my head off

kick back over hit back I know
their words justice and righteous
don't mean a thing to me

can you ever cry when the world splits in two
can you ever bleed for someone else's pain

see that flame hear that scream
I wish I could go blind and deaf
all dead-heads see the war from their warm secure home

suck their blood squeeze their neck taking everything away
how do you laugh when their lives are ripped and torn

trip out trip in
leave all behind
I spit into the sky but it takes me nowhere

take my clothes off
I walk down the street
oh my precious invaders please shoot through my head

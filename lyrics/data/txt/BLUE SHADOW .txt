Where do our words go to
I try to look for answers
You have always said that
I should be stronger

The vision
Of last night
Is at the corner of the room
Vibrating
And fading
It's out of reach

Hope lies
In blue shadow
Don't get lost and stop there
You just don't know where
To go
All right
The blue shadow
Color soft and vivid
You just don't know yet
That much is true

Being watched from far by
Collective thoughts that I had
Liberated feelings
Will make the time flow

Hope lies
In blue shadow
Don't get lost and stop there
You just don't know where
To go
All right
The blue shadow
Color soft and vivid
You just don't know yet
That much...
So now
You can't follow
Time to make your own call
So you won't get lost
Chasing my steps
The blue shadow
Color soft and vivid
You just don't know yet
That much is true

Bring it on down I'm used to being numb
The sense of incongruity I guess I'm just dumb
Now keep it on forever calculating every sum
Cause that's all what you ever do
You'll never make me cum

What did it mean? Would we ever really realize?
I hope it ends when it's over being mesmerized
Bring it on down I'm proud of being dumb
The calling just refrains again come on come on come on

立ち止まらせる今 again we face another debt
あがくように もがくように
果てるまで 『生きて』みせよう

Feel and think And I believe I know
言葉を飲み込み
あの日のように I sing that song again

“Cherish your life”he said with all the might,
but himself doesn't understand
why he's really here for
Pick up your shoes it's time to choose
You heard enough about it and you know that it is coming more

What did it mean? Would we ever fuckin'realize?
I hope it ends when we're over being mesmerized
Bring it on down We're proud of being dumb
The calling now refrains again come on come on come on

息継ぐひまもなく again I just remember you said
壊されない 止めさせない
うなずいて 走り出そう

Feel and think And I believe I know
痛みをかき消し
あの日のように I sing that song again

I feel and think And I believe I know
涙を飲み込み
Feel and think to free my soul again

Where did it go
Where is the real tomorrow

I feel and think Believe I know
すべてをかき消し

Feel and think And I believe I know
涙を飲み込み
Feel and think to sing that song again

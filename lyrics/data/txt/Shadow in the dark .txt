夜がとける うごめく影
怪しく甘いCrisis
時の狭間 闇の気配
開いた異界のBlack Gate

囚われの街がゆらぐ
太陽は消えた
堕ちて行く Evening Star

Shadow in the Dark.
Know true fear.
Fanatics make noise.
Don't look away. You will be tried.
Alone in the Night.
Know hidden truth.
It's worse than death.
Open your eyes. Open your heart.

Impending darkness.
Lurking danger.
The strange night tells warning.
Impending Dark One.
Lurking Outer Ones.
The strange dream become truth.

Ominous dark clouds have buried
the sunshine.
Ominous silence enfold all.
The doomsayer shouts downfall.

Shadow in the Dark.
Know true fear.
Fanatics make noise.
Don't look away. You will be tried.
Alone in the Night.
Know hidden truth.
It's worse than death.
Open your eyes. Open your heart.

始まりが終わりへ続いていても
終焉が未来を描くから……

Shadow in the Dark.
Know true fear.
Fanatics make noise.
Don't look away. You will be tried.
Alone in the Night.
Know hidden truth.
It's worse than death.
Open your eyes. Open your heart.

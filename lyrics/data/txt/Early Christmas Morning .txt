Listen to the children sing
Wath them dancing all'round the Chirstmas tree...
Waiting for the opening
Early Christmas morning...

All around the world is sleeping
Little children theres no peeping
Wait and see what Santa's bringing
Early Christmas morning...

Icicles and breakfast cakes...
Friends and family we will celebrate
Sound that joy and laughter wake
Early Christmas morning...

All around and far off places
Angels waken smiling faces
Wrapping us with love and graces
Early Christmas morning...
Early Christmas morning...

Listen to the children sing
Watch them dancing all'round the Chirstmas tree...
Waiting for the opening
Early Chrismas moving...

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

Little darling
It's been a long,cold,lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

Little darling
The smiles returning to their faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

Sun sun sun,here it comes
Sun sun sun,here it comes
Sun sun sun,here it comes
Sun sun sun,here it comes
Sun sun sun,here it comes

Little darling
I feel that is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's alright
It's alright

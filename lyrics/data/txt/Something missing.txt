I don't know where I'm gonna go today, so freely
Anywhere I'd like to spend my time all by myself

I don't know how you're gonna be today without me
Anyway I don't mind, spend your time all by yourself

I can do well without your help
Why not let me do all by myself?

I don't want you to care me so much
Don't you think I can do by myself?

I will go my way ta show my value
Even though you'd like to go far with me
Why do I feel something is missing
While I go alone? Do you know this feel?

I don't know how I'm gonna be today, so freely
Anyway I don't mind, spend my time all by myself

I don't know where you're gonna go today without me
Anywhere you'd like to spend your time all by yourself

You can do well without my help
Why can't let you do all by yourself?

I don't want to care you so much
I think you can do well by yourself

You can go your way to show your value
Even though I'd like to go far with you
But don't you feel that something is missing
While you go alone? Do you know this feel?

I don't know how you're gonna feel today without me
Anyhow I hope you feel this same feeling of mine

I don't know where I'm gonna go today, so freely
Anyway I think I'll go and find where you will be

大っきなあくびを一つしよう
カーテン開けて背伸びをしよう
体いっぱい光を浴びよう
優しく今日を始めてゆこう

However hard it will be, you got to carry on your life.
However tough it will be, you'll just wear your smile.

紅茶に砂糖を一つ入れよう
パンにバターをたっぷり塗ろう
ちゃんと噛んでゆっくり食べよう
美味しく今日を始めてゆこう

However hard it will be, you got to carry on your life.
However tough it will be, you'll just wear your smile.

忘れ物は無いか確かめよう
くつひもをしっかりと結ぼう
青空を見上げて立ち上がろう
真っすぐ今日を始めてゆこう

However hard it will be, you got to carry on your life.
However tough it will be, you'll just wear your smile.

Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb.
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star
Dancing in the night,
With a tail as big as a kite.
With a tail as big as a kite.

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy.
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song
High above the tree.
With a voice as big as the sea.
With a voice as big as the sea.

Said the shephered boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child
Shivers in the cold,
Let us bring Him silver and gold.
Let us bring Him silver and gold.

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say!
Pray for peace, people everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
The child, the Child,
Sleeping in the night.
He will bring us goodness and light.
He will bring us goodness and light.

He will bring us goodness and light.

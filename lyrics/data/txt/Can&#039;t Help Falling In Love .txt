Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

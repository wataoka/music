Eyes still closed Sunshine showed
Through the curtains and the noise

I awoke to your voice
Thinking you'll be by my side

You and I lay close in heart
Please save us from being apart
Time ran too fast to feel
your warmth and love

※※Never too long or harsh
　　Always, Beside you
　　that's all I wished for
　　Never too sad or hard
　　Can't bear, loosing, my everything

Walking down flight of stairs
Leaving path of footsteps

Sitting down on a chair
Leaving shadow to share

Standing still with nothing new
Staring down at my shoe in tears
Want to follow what you left behind for me?

Never too short or cold
Always, Beside you
That's all I wished for
Never too sad or hard
Apart from today, you have gone away

I just found your letter
I feel your sadness worlds apart
and no words can say
&quot;I'm sorry&quot;
you're everything that matters
and forever I'll know that
if you call my name
I'll follow
in all my life
no one so real
untainted love
with you I can ascend
I'll go with you
I won't look back
I won't look back
I won't look back
I won't look back
I won't look back
so don't look back
I won't look back
I can call you love
you can call me lover
you can call me love
I can call you lover
let me call you love
won't you call me lover
won't you please say &quot;love&quot;
I'll love you forever
hold out my hand
I call your name
please take me there
no, I will not look back
I go with you
I go with you
I go with you
I'll grow with you
I go with you
I go with you

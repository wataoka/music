I gave up hopes and dreams long time ago
do you wanna be someone else? I used to be

some hope
some dream
some chance
some right
some trust
some love
left in the middle of nowhere

some hate
some lie
some sin
some hurt
some tear
stuck in the middle of nowhere

somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me our of here

somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me our of here

wish I had another world to live
wish I had another way to go

I get used to the way I try to pretend
no one understands me what I'm thinking

some hope
some dream
some chance
some right
some trust
some love
left in the middle of nowhere

some hate
some lie
some sin
some hurt
some tear
stuck in the middle of nowhere

somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me our of here

somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me out of this crazy sh★t
somebody help me our of here

wish I had another world to live
wish I had another way to go

Tell me what you're dreaming bout tonight
I never want to get you go
The lips that kissed my lashes and you sleepy smile
Sinking into the darkest night A breezeiess flow in the afterglow
You and me together we could go that extra mile

Sweet nothing and time Only you and the rhyme
Dizzy vertigo Round and round as we go

Amazing Kiss Shining stars and I'll miss
The flame that used to be ours ours alone
Cuz we made it happen…our miracle
True and blue to our oracle
Precious in my love…tu ru tu…yeah
I Remember…

Amazing Kiss This is only shooting star
The love that used to be ours, I'm in love wow who
Joy, Affcetion…our universe
Supernatural whirles
Precious in my love…tu ru tu…yeah

Looking for words our brainwaves Found a way to communicate
Secret sounds that you and I monopolize
The moon reflected on the waves Moving in time reverberates
Drifting ashore to you…deep into your eyes

As I lay awake
Another night of heartbreak
Longing for you Hits me out of the blue

Amazing Kiss Sprinkled pieces of bliss
Promises that we'll be forevermore
In the Miky Way I guess it's no more
Don't you remember our vow,oh
Precious in my love…tu ru tu…yeah
I Remember…

Amazing Kiss This is only shooting star
The love that used to be ours, I'm in love wow who
Joy, Affcetion…our universe
Supernatural whirles
Precious in my love…tu ru tu…yeah

Tough enough to weather the hands of time
Cuz our dream beam's gonna shine on
You and I will come this way again True blue to our destiny
Leaning up against this wall of ice Never gonna let love fade away
I don't want you to go
So forevermore

Just the way you are…

Precious in my love Who yeah yeah…ya-
Just the way you are…
Precious in my love Who yeah yeah…ya-

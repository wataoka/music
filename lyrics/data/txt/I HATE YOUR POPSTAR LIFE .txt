You will surely give up this bad dream.
Yeah, you remember this bad dream again.

You are a doll,
Pretty slave.
表現の無き調べ

It's warning, post a warning.
成功を祝ってる?
流行はtransitory,
Petty story,
Lower pleasure.

Go! Let's go!
You let's go!
Hey let's go!
The last once!

I told fxxk off!! 手を出した?
降り止まない銀のテープ
どう悪を? 腹に「Do you love me?」

You gotta feel it! I hate star life.

Your star life.
Your star life.
Your star life.

Hate, star life.
Hate, star life.
Hate, star life.
Popstar life.

It's warning, post a warning.
さあ今日も Idle pleasure.

Go! Let,s go!
You let's go!
Hey let's go!
Once more!

Go! Let's go!
You let's go!
Hey let's go!
The last once!

You mean fxxk off? 絵に書いた
憧れの顔 手にしたね
輪郭を歪めたSmily

I told fxxk off!! 手を出した?
降り止まない銀のテープ
どう悪を? 腹に 「Do you love me?」

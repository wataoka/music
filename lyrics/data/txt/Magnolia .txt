Come to me...“miss sleepless”,
In the swampland...I seek you
and on the sea, I steer you..
Plenty of avoidance.

She is my lucky girl out of my dream
and always smartest don't you realize.
Lightly... you tread the way with whipped cream
It's always hardest before I tantalize.

Come to me...“miss sleeveless”,
In the morass...I squeeze you
and on the street, I smell you..
There is no place to hide

Sorry, cony... I locked my door
I gave you words, So drink it some more

Now I'm everywhere
Now I am nowhere
And no more disorderly (so please...)

I don't need your blood
of magnolia
All I want to be in your love...

Now I'm everywhere
Now I am nowhere
and all is in this symphony

I don't need your blood
My dearly beloved
All I want to be in your arms...(love)

She is my lucky girl out of my dream
Sorry, cony... I locked my door
I gave you words, So drink it some more
It's always darkest before the dawn

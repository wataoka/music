I click the lights down low
I cannot see no more
抜け出せない もう手遅れ
Maybe I've got the shakes,
狭い got the shakes
Oh baby! Won't you get me out of here
I was lost, and now I found myself
もう逃げられない重力崩壊
Got the shakes? ススメ got the shakes
Oh baby! Won't you get me out of here

Non-stop You feel it?
廻り続ける
Stop! Stop!! You feel it?
吸い寄せられて
Non-stop
命革マッテいく
Stop do you know where you are?

Turn out the lights
And tell me that you're feeling alive
I know, that you've been feeling alive
Tell me that you'll go
Living on the rest of your life
Turn out the lights
And tell me that you're feeling alive
Oh! まだ見たことのない
Point of no return
Inside the event horizon tonight

I click the lights down low
I cannot see no more
抜け出せない もう手遅れ
Maybe I've got the shakes,
狭い got the shakes
Oh baby! Won't you get me out of here
I was lost, and now I found myself
もう逃げられない重力崩壊
Got the shakes? ススメ got the shakes
Oh baby! Won't you get me out of here

Turn out the lights
And tell me that you're feeling alive
I know, that you've been feeling alive
Tell me that you'll go
Living on the rest of your life
Turn out the lights
And tell me that you're feeling alive
Oh! まだ見たことのない
Point of no return
Inside the event horizon tonight

I was lost, and now I found myself
Run away from all of them voices in my head
Got them shakes oh yes I got them shakes
Oh baby! Won’ t you get me out of here

Non-stop you feel it?
I don't want you anymore
Stop! Stop!! You feel it?
I don't want you anymore

Stop! Stop!! You feel it?
I don't want you anymore
Stop! You know who you are

Turn out the lights
And tell me that you're feeling alive
I know, that you've been feeling alive
Tell me that you'll go
Living on the rest of your life
Turn out the lights
And tell me that you're feeling alive
Oh! まだ見たことのない
Point of no return
Inside the event horizon tonight
The rest of your LIFE!

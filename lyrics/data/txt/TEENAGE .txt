yesterday today tomorrow
100億の悲しみと夢と
よろこびと くやしさと
なぐさめと さみしさと

Music brings back to the teenage
through the twilight through the breakfast
Music brings back to the teenage
through the twilight through the sunset

by the way 世界中の今
それほどは気にもせず
せめて今夜だけでも
酒で楽しみをつくろう

Music brings back to the teenage
through the night through the midnight
Music brings back to the teenage
through the moment through the light

yesterday today tomorrow
道端でいつまでも
起きあがることもなく
眠り続ける無気力な人
1秒でも誰よりも
ハートビートを鳴らすため
若き頃の夢をなお
思い出す人もいる

Music brings back to the teenage
through the twilight through the breakfast
Music brings back to the teenage
through the twilight through the sunset

Music brings back to the teenage
through the night through the midnight

Music brings back to the teenage
through the night through the midnight
Music brings back to the teenage
through the moment through the light

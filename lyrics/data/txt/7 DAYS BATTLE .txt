Let me know when ur body getting sexy
Let me know when u get ready shorty
I show u'd never see what u really want to

Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to rock?

So many sorrows on planet So much mess on internet
I know u'd miss sweet mind I'll take u back

Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to rock?

Grown up on this street Like on the other side
Keep ur spotlight on this endless war

※I'm in battle (battle) battle (battle)
7 days I show u that I'll be dead or alive Yeah
I'm in battle (battle) battle (battle)
Whoever come on Coz u're not alone
Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to rock?※

Chapter 1 is real face Chapter 2 is II u 3 is queen of pirates
I've everything we gotta go

(One time) It's not game like (Two times) Not a kind of joke
(Three times) I don't trick u I promise u

Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to knock? Are u ready to rock?

My faith on this stage No faked and no faded
Believe the way six soldiers going on

(※くり返し)

マジHotなHip跳ねるFloorをVipから覗いてWink飛ばしChicとChill

Grown up on this street Like on the other side
Keep ur spotlight on this endless war

I'm in battle (battle) battle (battle)
7 days I show u that I'll be dead or alive Yeah
I'm in battle (battle) battle (battle)

Go for whatever that you want to be
Go on and never mind your enemies
Eighteen lasting memories
Don't try to make sense out of everything

Complicated (Such a shitty) life came down all so suddenly
I didn't know what to do
I need you to stay with me

Let go the stress and pressure
Let go whatever's on your mind
Let in the positivity

When there is nowhere left to go
When there is nothing left to lose
I will live for something new
Pick up the broken pieces of you

She is in her summer fashion
Take it slow and feel the passion
Tasty girls are always up to date

Before I lose you, too

Before I end up losing you again

What the hell happened to me
I've become such a mess
I'm a walking disaster
On a road full of stress
You got all that you wanted
You got the good part of me
And I'm getting kind of dizzy
From this crazy disease

So get me a doctor
I need a repair
I'm pushing my limits
and pulling out my hair

And it's all because of u
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because of u
It's all because of u

You've got me spinning like a record
that's already worn out
And I'm kicking and I'm screaming
and repeating myself
I gotta hold myself together and not fall apart
If it's gonna be forever tell me where do I start

So send me a signal
Up in the air
You're pushing my buttons
I'm pulling out my hair

And it's all because of u
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because of u

I can't help it
Can't stop it
I know it's all your fault
But I like it and you love me
Yeah yeah yeah

It's all because of u
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because and it's all because of u
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because of uâ€¦.It's all because of u

So hard to stay cool when someone's
got you running hot and cold
You try not to lose your mind you try
harder not to lose your self control
I tell my self to stay strong
but every time you touch me I get weak
I'm only human I can hear the voice inside me
speak it's telling me

Don't dance close don't kiss back don't
hold hands don't let him back
Feet stay firm eyes don't stare
head stay down hips beware
Lips don't smile ears work sound ignore
his touch heart don't pound
Throat don't cheke body don't sweat
I'm trying not to have regrets but I'm coming this close

This close to giving it up 
(I) this close (came) this close (How?)
This close to giving it up 
(I was like) this close (about) this close (How?)
This close to giving it up 
(just) this close (this) this close (How?)
This close to giving it up 
(to) giving it up (to) giving up

I was so elated but my participations close to none
I still can't believe it
but I must pretend that I am numb
I want to keep from slipping
if I slip baby deeper and deeper I'll go
I'm trying not to give in
if I give a little I'm a give it all
My voice keeps telling me.

Don't dance close don't kiss back don't
hold hands don't let him back
Feet stay firm eyes don't stare
head stay down hips beware
Lips don't smile ears work sound ignore
his touch heart don't pound
Throat don't cheke body don't sweat
I'm trying not to have regrets but I'm coming this close

This close to giving it up 
(I) this close (came) this close (How?)
This close to giving it up 
(I was like) this close (about) this close (How?)
This close to giving it up 
(just) this close (this) this close (How?)
This close to giving it up 
(to) giving it up (to) giving up

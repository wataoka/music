It's funny you don't see
It's somthing you can't let go
Living in your world...pretend

It's just so funny how you lie
It's time to break free from your past
And touch the truth you hide so well

If you run fast enough
Then maybe you'll stop yourself
From making the same mistake twice
Can you hear me?
If you try hard enough
Then maybe you'll rise above
The black and white lies that you tell you

It's time to turn and face yourself

If you turn fast enough
Then maybe you'll catch yourself
And try to see things as they are
Open your eyes
If you look long enough
Then maybe you'll see enough
To change the way you have become
Stop pretending

If you run fast enough
Then maybe you'll stop yourself
From making the same mistake again
Please believe me
If you try hard enough
Then maybe you'll rise above
The black and white lies that you tell
Can you hear me?

Hey unisance bag your face
Don't enter this side of the fence
Hey I got a holy place
I don't have time to walk the maze
Hey to bear great offence
Play the drum, guitar, scratch and bass
Hey I must prove my case
I don't wanna trifle away my sense

Haunter Life!
龍気の音

迅雷、雷音、Dragon の闘気
闘争、武士の血、霊気を一閃

Hey unisance bag your face
Don't enter this side of the fence
Hey I got a holy place
I don't have time to walk the maze
Hey to bear great offence
Play the drum, guitar, scratch and bass
Hey I must prove my case
I don't wanna trifle away my sense

Haunter Life!
龍気の音!

士気鼓舞が拍子、雷電、真我
真紅の契り、共鳴の一撃

Even if it's a momentary feeling
I want to feel that I am infinite
Even if it's a momentary delight
I want to feel that my way is right

蒼き餓狼 研ぎ澄ます牙 Speed up 加速してく波動
獅子の如く薙ぎ倒す今 スピーカーで消し飛ばす孤独
待つ試練や 抱えたジレンマ 貫ける刃たった一つ
I believe myself and my way
振りかざし I gotta kill the ghost

Haunter Life!
龍気の音

迅雷、雷音、Dragon の闘気
闘争、武士の血、霊気を一閃
士気鼓舞が拍子、雷電、真我
真紅の契り、共鳴の一撃

Even if it's a momentary feeling
I want to feel that I am infinite
Even if it's a momentary delight
I want to feel that my way is right

Even if it's a momentary feeling

闘争、武士の血、霊気を一閃

Even if it's a momentary feeling

真紅の契り、共鳴の一撃

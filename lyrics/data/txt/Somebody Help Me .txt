I'm being haunted by whisper
A chill comes over me
I've been trapped inside this moment
I'm not a victim, I'm not a freak

Free me / before I slip away
Heal me / wake me from this day
Can somebody help me?

I've seen the face of affliction of my reality
I'm being tortured by the future of things
that are yet to be

I'm being haunted by a vision
It's like the moment never comes
I feel the burden of confusion, always searching... on the run

Free me / before I slip away
Heal me / wake me from this day
Can somebody help me? somebody help me?

Now, I'm not a hero... no
But the weight of world's is on my soul
These images burn my eyes
They're burning me up inside

Free me / before I slip away
Heal me / wake me from this day
Can somebody help me?

Free me / before I slip away
Heal me / wake me from this day
Can somebody help me?

Somebody help me, somebody help me

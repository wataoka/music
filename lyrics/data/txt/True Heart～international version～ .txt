I guess I know
You've already decided to go
out of my life once more
no turning back thats for sure

before you do
girl please promise to tell me the truth
and if this must be so
darling I just have to know

※
When did your heart stop loving me
where did it all go wrong
how can it be we're suddenly weak
when we used to be so strong
※

※※
When did your eyes start wandering
how could those feeling die
I can't believe this wasn't to be
it's tearing me up inside
※※

it seems so strange
how such precious emotions can change
all that we held so dear
somehow became so unclear

I just can't see why the magic died
or the reason love slipped through our hands
help me to understand
I'm still trying to understand, oh...

Ohhh...wow...
Baby,don't go wrong...

I guess...
I know...
You've already decided to go...

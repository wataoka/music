SHE DANCES IN A GOOD MOOD WITH HER
APRON ON AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK IN TOWN
SHE GIVES HER LOVE TO ALL THE KIDS AT THE PARTY
THEY DON'T NEED THEIR DADS

IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE FOR HER TO SHOW
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE HEART
I'LL COME TO SEE HER ON SUNDAY HOLDING MOM'S HAND

IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING,
JUST I COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE
I'VE LOST MY FRIEND MY PRECIOUS FRIEND

SHE RELAXES IN A ROCKING CHAIR
SHE USED TO PLAY WITH IT BY SWINGING SO HARD
WE ENJOYED & LAUGHED TOGETHER
IT WAS THE BEST SMILE I EVER HAD

I STARTED PLAYING THE PIANO
THAT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE TO SHOW
WHAT I FEEL I WAS CHASING MY LITTLE DREAM

IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING,
JUST I COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE
I'VE LOST MY FRIEND MY PRECIOUS FRIEND

I WAS SO SELFISH & WEAK
WHAT I DID FOR HER HELPED ME SO MUCH
WHY DIDN'T I GO TO SEE HER BEFORE SHE WNET TO HEAVEN

IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING,
JUST I COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE
I'VE LOST MY FRIEND MY PRECIOUS FRIEND

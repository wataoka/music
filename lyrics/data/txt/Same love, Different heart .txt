きっとね思いは同じだろう
離れているけど
繋がる言葉は記憶の底
見上げるこの空

嘘をつくと膨らんだ
小鼻の癖も愛しい

どこでも近くに感じてる
離れているから
強がる気持ちを風に乗せて
私はここに

薬指のおまじない
キスをすれば覚えてる

あなたとおなじ思い出を全て
並べる面影
あなたがいない思い出を捨てて
いま逢いに行くわ

you look up at the moon when I look down
but you don't have to come here now
visit spots where we have been before
you may find you can touch me there

It's hard for us to make new recollections
but it's easy to go back to the road we have walked

I want you not to forget me
your ring finger twinkles by
I don't know what is just fair yet
your sorrow for me comforts me

I want you not to forget me
you know any kind of time goes by
I have gone I've done and I love you
that's the only truth I swear by

your ring finger twinkles by
I don't know what is just fair yet
you and I are still confused

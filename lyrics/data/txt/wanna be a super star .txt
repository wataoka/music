the anthem. shout it louder.
just pump it up. home boy.
lady luck is smiling on me.
in effect. we gotta footie cut for you.

いざグリーンの聖地へ
we are crazy. 剥いでくバリケード
行くぞ let it go. that's my game.
always 狙うゴールネット
ハーフウェーラインの向こうへ
栄光のエンブレムへ刻め your name.
this is football.

hey, we are studium boys and girls.
マスターピースはピッチに響くチャント
football 芝の上に立つ
say wow 誇りを胸に抱く
I believe my green. sing for my team.
field and stand. 繋ぐ my dream.
ホイッスルだ you wanna come with us?
雷鳥は頂を目指す

the anthem. shout it louder.
just pump it up. home boy.
lady luck is smiling on me.
in effect. we gotta footie cut for you.

hey, we are ptarmigans. aren't you?
会場は踊り出す do you?
it's moving football. touching soccer. since 1965.
紡ぎ出すビート 駆け上がるスピード
唸るアルウィンを覆い尽くすグリーン
one for the fans. two for the cup.
揺らす歓声 預ける背中
クレバーなプレイは wild and sexy.
ラインブレイク 狙うスペース
俺は反逆のヘラクレス
team Y.M.G 駆け上がれ for giant killing

the anthem. shout it louder.
just pump it up. home boy.
lady luck is smiling on me.
in effect. we gotta footie cut for you.

you gotta be a superstar.
we gotta ready. time has come.
流した涙が染み込んだグラウンド
all kind of louds are for you.
揺れる winning flag with yell.

the anthem. shout it louder.
just pump it up. home boy.
lady luck is smiling on me.
in effect. we gotta footie cut for you.

I never had that many friends growing up
So I learned to be
Ok with
Just me, just me, just me, just me
And I'll be fine on the outside

I like to eat in school by myself
Anyway
So I'll just stay
Right here, right here, right here, right here
And I'll be fine on the outside

So I just sit in my room after hours with the moon
And think of who knows my name
Would you cry if I died
Would you remember my face?

So I left home, I packed up and l moved
Far away
From my past one day
And I laugh, I laugh, I laugh, I laugh
And I sound fine on the outside

Ha ha ha...

Sometimes I feel lost, sometimes I'm confused
Sometimes I find
That I am not alright
And I cry, and I cry, and I cry....

Ha ha ha...

So I just sit in my room after hours with the moon
And think of who knows my name
Would you cry if I died
Would you remember my face?

Wait It's got to be a mistake Making another pain
Nothing is going straight Wishing a good luck
I wait be there Now I am back in the war

20seconds to jump Don't wanna hurt you
Are you ready to dive This is a real life
20seconds to jump I'm ready for it
Where I wanted to be Cause I am back in the war

Come along I am going
Place my eyes into your skin
You will not feel the blindness
Hold on tight till we reach it
Heading to right direction
Ain't nobody's gonna teach me
60times I can breathe in
Wait for the call

I know this is not a good time
Got the feeling of a crashing
If you're forcing me to rush it
Don't bother me I'm deep in the ocean

Wait It's got to be a mistake Making another pain
Nothing is going straight Wishing a good luck
Leave it to me You know nothing about it
I wait be there Now I am back in the war

20seconds to jump Don't wanna hurt you
Are you ready to dive This is a real life
20seconds to jump I'm ready for it
Where I wanted to be Cause I am back in the war

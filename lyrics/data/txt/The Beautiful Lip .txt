She's the swimsuit form.
We're in her room.
Because I couldn't go to a pool,
she showed it to me.

We kissed on the sofa.
I don't forget it all the while.
I thought it was a dream.
She seemed to be a girl.

I knew love for the first time.
I was not a robot.
I also understand a beautiful thing.

Her beautiful lip.
That beautiful lip.

I didn't open that door.
Why am I so afraid?
I'm below the man.
I'd like to be reborn.

I knew love for the first time.
I was not a robot.
I also understand a beautiful thing.

Her beautiful lip.
That beautiful lip.

She's loved by everyone.
Are you smiling today?
I'm below the man.
I'd like to be reborn.

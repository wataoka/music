No kidding you always have a lot of complains
You can't catch up with the Harley D so
Don't waste your time
It feels good oh, how much bills I have
My lovers left me coz I enjoy the Disney's Yeah
I don't even know where I'm suppose to be oh, no
I think funny things everybody keeps themselves improving
Uhâ€¦ In changing the world on,
How selfish you are
And you know it is always an one-man show

Even if you are so cool, so fuckin' cool
I only give you 80, not a perfect grade
Coz all human are so weak, so weak
They can't improve themselves without starving
Just don't give yourself wow 100 points

So I can't stand only 80 points
The fact is, that you want to improve
Yourself, it's the right thing
How about you

Even if you are so cool, so fuckin' cool
I only give you 80, not a perfect grade
Coz all human are so weak, so weak
They can't improve themselves without starving
Just don't give yourself wow
Just don't give yourself wow 100 points

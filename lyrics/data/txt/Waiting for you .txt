I'm waiting, waiting for, waiting for you dear lover
I'm waiting, waiting for, waiting for your love

Don't you wanna know?
True story goes…he'll come around
When he finds a rhythm of his own, you know

Darling I, I'm getting hungry for your touch
But you know, darling I, will patiently wait for you to know

Oooohh, I'm still waiting for, waiting for, your sweet laughter
I'm still waiting, waiting for, waiting for you boy

Don't let it go…Don't you think I know?
What do I say, ay, ay, if I let you see my heart

Ahh, Darling I, pray that you're laughing from your heart
Cuz baby, it's time that I, water the roots you grow on your own

You're one of a kind

『you know how I feel』

You don't know

Darling I, I'm getting hungry for your touch
But you know, darling I, will patiently wait for you to show
I found you

Don't let go, I've been beside you all this time
So help me, darling breath, take my hand and then we're found
And then we're found

I know you wish you'd drift away into the darkness babe
I pray the music lifts your heart and dries your tears away
I know you're wasting there, you're gonna get his right, just listen
I pray you hear it dear, the sky is brighter, dawn is coming

I'm waiting for your…
I'm waiting for your…
I'm waiting for your…

さあ手を伸ばし　私の元へ　迷う事など　何も無いから
守ってあげる　笑ってあげる　泣きたくなったら　眠らせてあげる
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
CAN YOU RESCUE ME. SO MAKE ME CONQUEST YOU.
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
YOU CAN'T RESCUE ME. I KNOW THE CONQUEST TRUE.

柔らかい頬に爪を起ててみる　胸が痛む分だけ
私の鼓動誰にも聞かせない　ノイズで埋め尽くして

あなたの全て　受け取ってあげる　振り向けばほら　ここにいるから
両手広げて　廻っているわ　ここに居るから　閉じ込めてあげる
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
CAN YOU RESCUE ME. SO MAKE ME CONQUEST YOU.
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
YOU CAN'T RESCUE ME. I KNOW THE CONQUEST TRUE.

さあ手を伸ばし　私の元へ　飛び立つ先は　決まっているわ
守ってあげる…　抱きしめてあげる…
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
CAN YOU RESCUE ME. SO MAKE ME CONQUEST YOU.
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
YOU CAN'T RESCUE ME. I KNOW THE CONQUEST TRUE.

あなたの飲み残した愛のIZMは　この胸に吸収して
私の心の隙はここにはない　あなたの胸の中

声を出さずに　愛を唱えて　いつだって側で　聞いてあげるわ
あなたの最期　私の中よ　痛みの分だけ　泣き続けてあげる
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
CAN YOU RESCUE ME. SO MAKE ME CONQUEST YOU.
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
YOU CAN'T RESCUE ME. I KNOW THE CONQUEST TRUE.
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A TV JUNKY GIRL.
YOU CAN RESCUE ME. SO MAKE ME CONQUEST YOU.
I WAN'T OUR TIME. I WAS A LOVER JUNKY GIRL.
CAN'T YOU RESCUE ME. I KNOW THE CONQUEST TRUE.

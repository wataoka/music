So me and you, just dance

I feel lovin' その瞳に
心奪われて
淡い 夢の中
二人 落ちて行く

And I'm falling tonight
Dreamin' tonight
Want you tonight
Tonight

For me and you, just dance…
So why don't you just dance…
For me and you, just dance…
So why don't you, just dance…
For me and you, just dance…

I keep lovin' この気持ちを
何度もかき消した
だけど 気がつけば
君を探してる

And I'm calling tonight
Miss you tonight
Hold you tonight
Tonight

For me and you, just dance…
So why don't you just dance…
For me and you, just dance…
So why don't you, just dance…
For me and you, just dance…

And I'm falling tonight
Need you tonight
Love you tonight
Tonight
For me and you, just dance…
So why don't you just dance…
For me and you, just dance…
So why don't you, just dance…
For me and you, just dance…

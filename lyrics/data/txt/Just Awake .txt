重なってた胸の音
揺さぶっても聴こえない
こぼれ落ちたピース

こんな日常の憂鬱さえ
ため息も出ずに無感情な僕ら

Life filled with vanity
Colors have faded
Things you desire exist here
Flee from this colorless world

つぎはぎの心は不安定
洗い流された初期衝動を 呼び覚まして走り出せ
拙い言葉 思うままに繋ぐよ あの日の鼓動
忘れないで

Oh my lord, it's gone!!
What shall I do?
Pieces I had have fell apart
Where do you belong?
Where should I aim (for)?
Once you've lost sight it's left to fall apart

Let's start it over again

Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost
To become one
Like a puzzle
Take it one at a time

When I stopped (a) rusted chain tangled me up

Tying my body onto the ground
As I sink underground I call your name
What can I do to see the day light once more?

Tear it apart and rip it off
Break the chain now
Sink down or swim up
Fight your way through
Seek your way out
If you can not, you are left to drown deep inside
Chain tangled me harder, chocking my neck

強がってた僕のこと
見守ってた君は言う
今ここにいるよ

いつまでも消えない思いを
つなぎ止められた初期衝動を
呼び覚まして走り出せ
あの日の鼓動は
僕と君の中の宇宙で響いているよ

Misery is nothing
It is all up to your thoughts
and beliefs to bring in success within your life

Don't you compare yourself with other people
That's a waste of person you are so why not be honest to your emotion

All the promises made between us
Broke in pieces (and) turned into sand
Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
and tomorrow (that) we live

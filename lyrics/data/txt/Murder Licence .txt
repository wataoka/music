Can't you feel? This beat is changing.
Blood can't stop. My heart, my soul cries.
Don't stop me! I wanna change.
You understand? You changed me.

Can't you feel? The weight of your crime.
I'm just tired. Did you pull the trigger?
In that way. You should escape.
A broken thing is never restored.

I'll never forgive you mind. Break Down

Scream in a dream.
Where is your justice?
Just say it now!
Don't cry. Close your eyes
It drives me crazy.
Get out of my sight.
I hate your guts.
Give me. Murder Licence

I'll never forgive your mind. Break Down

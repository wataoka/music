Go! For it
This is the answer
Sing loud and take you higher
Oh oh oh oh
You can cry and smile

Go! For it
Light up a fire
Try! Make it brighter and brighter
Oh oh oh oh
We can fly and fight

Rockers in da house!!
This is a song for the one
Rockers in da house!!
Crying and feeling alone
Whatever, wherever, we don't ever mind
Don't hate anything
Rockers in da house!!

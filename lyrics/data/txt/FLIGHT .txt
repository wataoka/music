Feel like awaking lost way,
to lost way, to lost way

Keep flying forever
Carry on waiting for you

Because I let you find
Because I hold you tight
Because I want to make it,
want to make it perfet fight

Keep flying forever
Carry on waiting for you

Because I let you find
Because I hold you tight
Because I want to make it,
want to make it perfet fight

On your mark, on your mark...

oh-Keep on trying
oh-Keep on trying

Keep flying forever
Carry on waiting for you

Keep on baby, I need you
Keep on baby, I need you

To the other side, the other side, the other flying

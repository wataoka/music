This is the song of a kingfisher girl
Who sits by the side of the River of Life
And files in her mind over seven sad seas
Fiery her wings as so brightly she sings

Songs that are sweetened by one million moons
Songs that are mystic, exotically tuned
--songs that I sing to you

Sing, sing, sing out this song
Let it be heard all over the world

Cry, cry, cry silver tears
This is the song of “Wish You Were Here”

This is the song of a kingfisher girl
Who dives in the waters of love’s diamond depths
Who catches the fish that swim all through her blood
Sensually shining to taste on the tongue

The taste of dark honey that drips from the sun
The taste on these lips where all spices are spun
--ever, eternally… on…

Sing, sing, sing out this song
Let it be heard all over the world

Cry, cry, cry silver tears
This is the song of “Were You Were Here”

Fly, fly, coated in fire
Kingfisher girl, lone star of the sky

Dive, dive, dive into time
A moment alive where we’ll never die

Cry, cry, cry silver tears
This is the song of “Wish You Were Here”

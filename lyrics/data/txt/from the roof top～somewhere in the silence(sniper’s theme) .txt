clouds of another life
wash across the sunlight
changing shope as they go by
thought i saw your face there
but like them
you jus' disappear
disappear into empty sky
quietly
and so removed from reason
hey
the eagle comes and goes
to somewhere much higher
when the silence grows
can you hear it, sniper?

visions and memories
where some one once laid flowers
for the past and things to come
thought you were gone
but i can feel you
so i turn araound
furn araound yes, and there you are
here again
can you give it some meaning?
hey
ask again, but you say nothing
hey

motion without sound
ice inside the fire
the stillness in the storm
silence hides the sniper
eagles come and go
to someplace much higher
and where the silence grows
can you hearit, sniper?

what goes through your sniper's mind?

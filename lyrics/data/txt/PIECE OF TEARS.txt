I'm lost so,
Inside of me I say,
&quot;Don't trust anyone&quot;

And after,
Inside of me I say
&quot;Don't forgive anyone&quot;

I can't tell you my fear inside of me
But I'll show you what my horrible pain

I can't tell you my rage inside of me
But I'll show you what my horrible hate

I'm lost so,
Inside of me I say,
&quot;Don't trust anyone&quot;

And after,
Inside of me I say
&quot;Don't open my eyes&quot;

How can I find?
I don't know where I have lost piece of my tears?

How can I find?
I don't know, I don't care
Where the piece of my tears are

How can I find?
Where do I go? Where I am?
I lose my piece of my tears?

What's happend in my mind?
What's happend in my life?

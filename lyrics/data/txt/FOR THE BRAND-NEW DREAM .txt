Don't you cry now, don't be sorry
Yesterday is gone
'Cause baby, all good things must end
Try to smile now, don't you worry
Tomorrow's gonna come
And baby, we can still be friends

Through we have to part(It's time to go)
I know in my heart(One thing I know)
Life's what we make it, girl
And this is just the start

So baby, please remember
When we say goodbye
There'll be a brand-new dream
For you and I

Good luck and goodbye, baby
Doesn't mean the end now, my baby
We'll meet again now, baby
We'll find a way
For the brand-new dream

Did you ever get that feeling
Dreams could all come true
Just maybe, if you really try

Now it's time to let that feeling
Take control of you
Oh baby, spread your wings and fly

There's so much ahead(There's so much more)
Life's an open door(So much in store)
It's such a great big world
What are you waiting for

No baby, don't be lonely
When you think of me
Through far away I'll see you
In my dreams

So baby, please remember
When we say goodbye
There'll be a brand-new dream
For you and I

Good luck and goodbye, baby
Doesn't mean the end now, my baby
We'll meet again now, baby
We'll find a way
For the brand-new dream

Good luck and goodbye, baby
Doesn't mean the end now, my baby
We'll meet again now, baby
I just gotta say now, my baby
Good luck and goodbye, baby
Doesn't mean the end now, my baby
We'll meet again now, baby
But until that day now, my baby
Good luck and goodbye, baby
We'll find a way
For the brand-new dream

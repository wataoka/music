I can't pretend
Not to love the things you do or say
I didn't wanna fall again
I didn't wanna let you in

You look my way
Without a word I seem to understand
You can take my breath away
And in your arms I'm not afraid

There's a million stars out tonight
A million reasons to look in your eyes
So before I go
I just want you to know

Forever in my heart
Forever you will stay
Forever I'll be thankful
Forever you made me feel this way
Forever in my dreams
Forever you will be
Forever I will love love you
Cause you're the only one who can set my spirit free

Only time will reveal
If we'll be together once again
We must always believe
Believe that what we feel is real

There's a million stars out tonight
A million reasons to look in your eyes
So before I go
I just want you to know

Forever in my heart
Forever you will stay
Forever I'll be thankful
Forever you made me feel this way
Forever in my dreams
Forever you will be
Forever I will love you
Cause you're the only one who can set my spirit free

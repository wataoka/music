I don't know why we're afraid of it
Never ever feel it as today
I don't know what you pray for when you're alone
I don't know where we'll go tomorrow
Never ever lose the way for you
I'll know the reason of that we are still here

Take me high
Floating like a kite
Gently make me free
Holding a thousand dreams

流れる雲は ねぇ どこへ行くの?
What do you want?
What do you see? 未来は
いつの日か全てを 呑み込んでしまうけど
でも構わない
cause I will be there with you

I don't know why I miss the moon
Never ever felt as tonight
You don't have to be so nice
Just smile again

I don't know why I think of you
Never ever felt as today
You don't have to be so nice
Just be beside of me

Take you high
Floating like a bird
Gently make you free
Holding a thousand dreams

このままボクらは ねぇ どこへ行くんだろう?
What do you want?
What do you hear? 未来は
いつの日か全てを 呑み込んでしまうから
終わりの日も
oh, I will be there with you

蒼い空が海へ落ちる 言葉は色あせてく
赤い月が微笑みかける 指先に溢れる愛を

流れる雲は ねぇ どこへ行くの?
What do you want?
What do you see? 未来は
そのまま太陽さえ
呑み込んでしまうけど
でも構わない
cause we will be there again

I'm always be with you

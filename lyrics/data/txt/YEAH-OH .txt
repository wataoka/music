そんなにステップ見せられたら Can't keep in control (no-o no-o)
そんなに selfish じゃないけど But ready to blow (oh-h-h)

Dancing all night sing 止まらない
Dancing all night I say it たまらない
もうどうなっても構わない
今夜だけ そう It's quite alright

Feeling what I'm feeling no apology
Cause boy I know what I believe in and it's you and me
Don't you hold back this feeling cause this time I'm sure
We're singing yeah-o. singing yeah-h-h-o

どんなにストップかけられても Can't take anymore (mo-o-ore)
ヤバいリズムに体熱くなっていくの(no-o no-o)

Dancing all night sing 止まらない
Dancing all night I say it たまらない
もうどうなっても構わない
今夜だけ そう It's quite alright

Feeling what I'm feeling no apology
Cause boy I know what I believe in and it's you and me
Don't you hold back this feeling cause this time I'm sure
We're singing yeah-o. singing yeah-h-h-o

Dance to the same beat, move like you move me,
love like you can't breathe
Dance to the same beat, move like you move me,
love like you can't breathe

It doesn't make sense for you to hold back on this love
It doesn't make sense for us to ever give this up
It doesn't make sense baby it doesn't make sense for us
So common get it closer, common get it closer

Dancing all night sing 止まらない
Dancing all night I say it たまらない
もうどうなっても構わない
今夜だけ そう It's quite alright

Feeling what I'm feeling no apology
Cause boy I know what I believe in and it's you and me
Don't you hold back this feeling cause this time I'm sure
We're singing yeah-o. singing yeah-h-h-o

Dance to the same beat, move like you move me,
love like you can't breathe
Dance to the same beat, move like you move me,
love like you can't breathe

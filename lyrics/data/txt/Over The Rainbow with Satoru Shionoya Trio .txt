When all the world is a hopeless jumble
and the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens the magic lanc.

When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found.
Leading from your window pane
To a place behind the sun
Just a step beyond the rain.

Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't I?

Someday I'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?

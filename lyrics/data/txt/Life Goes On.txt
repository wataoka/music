I'm gonna head towards a brand new place where no one has been before
'Cos we will never change what has gone You know what I mean
Talking to myself &quot;what is the best?&quot; &quot;What is the right way?&quot;
Little dreamer still hasn't found what he's looking for

Will desire or despair? Undo the chain of my heart
There's fire inside of me Don't look back
Can't you see that clear blue sky
Breaking out an aggressive flag
Life goes on… All I wanna do is fly

Nobody is gonna get perfect life No matter what you do
But I am just trying to find my place here in the real world
Never worried what I'm gonna do now My soul will never sink
Little sleeper will awake a dream now Just like a storm

Will you make it or you break it? Everything's in your hands
Get on your way! Hey! Right away! Don't look back
Can't you hear the song in your heart
It will lead you to tomorrow
Life goes on… All I wanna say is &quot;yes&quot;

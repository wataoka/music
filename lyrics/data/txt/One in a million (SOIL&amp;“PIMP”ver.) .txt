One night in a million nights
I'd be in your sight
Open your eyes

One love in a million lives
You can shine me bright
Turn on my light inside

Once upon a time
Little piece of love was dropped into the sea

Long long time has passed
Love is grown up and it started to reprise

Living my life I live it my own way
I don't worry I know what I should pay
Listen to me I do mean what I say
I've been waiting for you, I'm sure you may understand
If you only come close to me

One night in a million nights
I'd be in your sight
Open your eyes

One love in a million lives
You can shine me bright
Turn on my light inside

It is hard to find
Little pebbles at the bottom of the sea

It has been so long
Since I started waiting
Can you find me please

Living my life I live it my own way
I don't worry I know what I should pay
Listen to me I do mean what I say
I've been waiting for you, I'm sure you may understand
If you only come close to me

One night in a million nights
I'd be in your sight
Open your eyes

One love in a million lives
You can shine me bright
Turn on my light

One night in a million nights
I'd be in your sight
Open your eyes

One love in a million lives
You can shine me bright
Turn on my light

One night in a million nights
I'd be in your sight
Open your eyes

One love in a million lives
You can shine me bright
Turn on my light inside

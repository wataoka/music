Daddy thank you for your kiss
Did you know How much I loved you
Daddy thank you for your kiss
in the past, only once

I'll let you go along the shining blue sky
I'll let you go along Don't look back

But I awoke from a dream
I call for you over and over again

Black berries make Daddy smile
Raspberries make Mommy smile
Sweet berries make me cry oh cry

Mommy thank you for your kiss
Did you know How much I needed you
Mommy thank you for your kiss
Reaching out for you

I'll let myself go along

But I awoke from a dream
I call for you over and over again

Black berries make Daddy smile
Raspberries make Mommy smile
Sweet berries make me cry oh cry

I'll let you go along the shining blue sky
I'll let you go along Don't look back

But I awoke from a dream
I call for you over and over again

Black berries make Daddy smile
Raspberries make Mommy smile
Sweet berries make me cry oh cry

I lost my name who am I
I lost my home where am I
But I can fly high fly high so far
So far away

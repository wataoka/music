[BENI] Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
[Tynisha] Uh huh, sure you know, you look kinda familiar.
[BENI] Yeah, you do too but, umm, I just wanted to know
do you know somebody named you, you know his name.
[Tynisha] Oh, yeah definatly, I know his name.
[BENI] I just wanted to let you know that he's mine.
[Tynisha] Huh... No no, he's mine!

[Both]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
seem 2 b confused
He belongs 2 me
The boy is mine

[BENI]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane

[Tynisha]
You see I know that you may be
Just bit jealous of me
Cuz you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

[BENI]
You see I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day ain't that a shame

[Tynisha] Maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
But my love is all it took

[Both]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Tynisha]
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it girl it's true

[BENI]
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

[Tynisha]
You can say what you want to say
What we have you can't take
from the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

[BENI]
When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
And if you didn't know the boy is mine

[Both]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
(Repeat)

[Tynisha]
You can't destroy this love I found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

[BENI]
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
This special place in my heart
Cause he was my love right from the start

[Both]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Tynisha] Not yours
[BENI] But mine
[Tynisha]  Not yours
[BENI] But mine
[Tynisha] Not yours
[BENI] But mine

[Both]
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
the boy he's mine

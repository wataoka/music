go round and round
move in a spiral
around again
and reach you

go round and round
a bird is singing
that calls for blue wind

I hold it, which I haven't seen
the softly... new sin
but someday I will
surely... with my dirty hands

lead me
when the moment of my end arrives
I wish
these eyes will open wide

please see the end of me
please see the end of me

please see and kill me, please

add ground to the earth
fill it up with the ocean
where do we sprinkle our own bones?
and where are we going?

there are days that I want to protect
though there are some oaths about things,
I can't keep my dreams...
now... past... and you

If you let me... If I lose
there is no deceit
and I wish I can exist
surely I'll take you... I'll take you...

lead me
when the moment of my end arrives
I wish
these eyes will open wide

please see the end of me
please see the end of me

please see and kiss me, please

burning asphalt stings my bare feet
I don't care to jump out of here
but I want to see you
tomorrow again

lead me
when the moment of my end comes
I wish
these eyes will open wide
I believe it
someday... someday
I'll reach you

I can't heal everything
but I'll
take them and you

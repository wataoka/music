Look at me,
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on?
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland
alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

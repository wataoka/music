I feel...Even if there is not a soul here
Your dazzling light

Even if time forgot you
Nothing needs to change
Even if you lose sight of oneself
Nothing changes
Be yourself...
Live for oneself this time

The thing which you left...
The words of your last
All which you loved
I believe that nothing changes
The thing which you left...
The words of your last
All facts and the truth
Nobody can take it away from me

I feel...Your breathing and pulse
Disease? Can't you see that light?
Teach it...Can only I see it?
Why do you watch me with such a sad eyes?

Till this darkness disappears
I write your name in the sky
Surely you should be angry
I understand it...sorry

The thing which you left
The words of your last
All facts and the truth
Teach it...

Can't you see that light?

I feel...Your breathing and pulse
Disease? Can't you see that light?
Teach it...Can only I see it?
Why do you watch me with such a sad eyes?

The thing which you left...
The words of your last
All which you loved
I believe that nothing changes
The thing which you left...
The words of your last
All facts and the truth
Nobody can take it away from me

You was crying over my corpse
I died on that day...In your chest
You was crying over my corpse
I died...

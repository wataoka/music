Once in your life you will find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know
You're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way cross town
Wonderin' to yourself
Hey what have I found

When you get caught
Between the moon and Tokyo City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught
Between the moon and Tokyo City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life his master's toys
And deep in his heart he's just
He's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a pretty good time
He's laughing about the way
They want him to be

When you get caught
Between the moon and Tokyo City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught
Between the moon and Tokyo City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

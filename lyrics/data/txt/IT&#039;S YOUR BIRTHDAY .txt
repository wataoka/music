Got a feeling when I woke up this morning
Got something to do
It's a very special day for somebody
Maybe it's you?

Get up and go
Don't you see that I need you so?
I want to say...

As long as you want me
As long as you need me
We'll be together forever more

It's a special day don't let it get away now
Don't open your eyes, you'll ruin the surprise now

Got a feeling driving down the highway
I'm thinking of you
Gotta make it to your place before sunset
To surprise you

It's time to go
Don't you see

As long as you want me
As long as you need me
We'll be together forever more

It's a special day don't let it get away now
Don't open your eyes, you'll ruin the surprise now
Happy birthday to you, my love

Now all of your friends are together
Waiting for you

As long as you want me
As long as you need me
We'll be together forever more

It's a special day don't let it get away now
Don't open your eyes, you'll ruin the surprise now
Everybody's singing, time to celebrate now
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you, my love

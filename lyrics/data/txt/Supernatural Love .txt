I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
One way or another, no time to lose
You won't find a better girl, if you wanna go,
Then you are wrong
Boy, you gotta break it down

Hush hush hush
I can't come down, why don't you help me out
Rush rush rush
I'm way too high, help me step off the cloud
Don't pick it up and put it back down
Baby, we should better work it out
Rush rush rush
No, I won't let you down

I will make you fall(like a supernatural love)
Cause love is what you want… Gonna take your defense down

Why don't you want me
Tereka teka supernatural love
Take it from me
Tereka teka supernatural love
Why don't you want me
Tereka teka supernatural love
Why don't you want me

There ain't no use in trying to hide
Boy, I'm gonna take you where you wanna go
And you should know
Boy, you gotta break it down

Hush hush hush
I love the sound of your name on my lips
Rush rush rush
It's like I'm missing what I can't resist
Don't pick it up and put it back down
Baby, we should better work it out
Rush rush rush
No, I won't let you down

I will make you fall(like a supernatural love)
Cause love is what you want… Gonna take your defense down

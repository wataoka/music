In the city I watch glamour shows
Through the windows of skyscraping expectations

Brainwash dreaming black and white
Setting up the surface with very shiny toys

Times goes by, make-up doesn't cover it
What will you do now?
Now that you've lost it
Hope you have a back up plan

Nothing's gonna take my love
Nothing's gonna take my love
I built my life underneath
The fiery storms can't reach me

Nothing's gonna take my love
Nothing's gonna take my love
Beneath runs a stream that connects with the ocean unbound
What you are looking for
What you are looking for
What you are looking for

You sparked your interior into a blaze and
Frantically threw a lightening bolt at me

Sweet of you to invite me to your chaotic spectacle
You've waken the little moths in my blood stream

Fluttering,makes it hard to understand
I wait till they calm down
Till they are sleeping
So I can see again

Nothing's gonna take my love
Nothing's gonna take my love
My wink flashes and I'll give you a grin
I don't let it get into me

Nothing's gonna take my love
Nothing's gonna take my love
Everything above is shifting constantly
But inside it will never go away
Never go away
Never go away

Nothing's gonna take my love
Nothing's gonna take my love
I built my life underneath
The fiery storms can't reach me

Nothing's gonna take my love
Nothing's gonna take my love
Beneath runs a stream that connects with the ocean unbound
What you are looking for
What you are looking for
What you are looking for

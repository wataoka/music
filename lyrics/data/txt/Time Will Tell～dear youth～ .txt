Crashed young lives and the confidence and the pride
A proof of "me" naked is showing
Noise makes more noise
The discord more than discord
It crashed to the dry and wastes the land

I say such a noise is fit wounded my soul and my body
I was afraid of that I changed, but I knew the strength of changing

Time will tell after the days
You guys young and fresh,
We entrust to you
Feel easy to you, Lonely heart is closed

All of you, stay as you are

Crashed young lives and the confidence and the pride
A proof of "me" naked is showing
Noise makes more noise
The discord more than discord
It crashed to the dry and wastes the land

I say such a noise is fit wounded my soul and my body
I was afraid of that I changed, but I knew the strength of changing

Time will tell after the days
A plenty of treasures you've got in your youth
Shining beautifully, Quietly alone

All of you, stay as you are

Time will tell after the days
You, stay as you are

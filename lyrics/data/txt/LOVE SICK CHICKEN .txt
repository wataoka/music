夢みてる Love sick chicken, honey
Or even like a bitch in heat
つらいことも あるだろうけど
いつも Bad days ばかりじゃ

(Since he's been gone I cry)
涙にくれる日々 夢の中さまようより
Your head is gonna need a rest
眠れない Hard day's night
なんか 忘れてしまえば

Don't you worry, sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call

Pa, pa, pa… fu…
Pa, pa, pa…
If you know just what I mean …alright

恋しても 悲しいかぎりね
The sunshine always follows rain
夢は夢 通り過ぎてく
He's just another memory

Don't you worry, sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call

Pa, pa, pa… fu…
Pa, pa, pa…
If you know just what I mean

Don't you worry, sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call

Don't you worry, sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call

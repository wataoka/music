Rain, the rain
Pours down on me
Soaks my shoulders
I walk all alone
With no umbrella
“Tear drops from sky high, wash my emotions away
from me now...”
Wishing as I gaze up the sky with saddened eyes
But I know it has no use at all

Wonder why I'm here by myself
I try to search for your trace
But can't find it...
As my tears fell the pouring rain turned into drizzle

Sing a song with my clothes wet
The song I wrote for you who's gone
I'll keep walking and I will have my head up high
The Ley-line could it be a spirits way?
Can it be a dead way I try to walk?
Either way I will keep moving my feet

Puddles reflect me
My eye sight so clear
Now I can look all the way
I can see far out

Foot Prints
Trace of path remained on the surface
It's the evidence that I am alive
The rainbow hanged over the blue sky like an arc
Connects the distance between you and I
Rain is gone and sun has risen

I raise my hands because the sun start to smile
Damped sneakers has dried up
I take a stretch and breath in fresh air to fill my lungs
Now I 'll start to walk again

Knew that I'm the only one who could save myself
I am the one that has to step up (and) crash all the walls
that stands high up against me and take the challenge

Sing a song under the sun
The song I wrote after you left
I'll keep walking and I promise to keep walking
The Ley-line guess it is a spirits way
Cannot be a death way which I am on
Either way I will keep moving my feet

I used to regret for what I have lost,
but I guess it makes no mean so I'll move on

I'll sing to the sky

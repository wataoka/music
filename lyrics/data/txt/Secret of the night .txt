I see a man getting beaten It's the mob
who's been kicking Behind the screen,
blood is trickling and there's
no one out there to save him
That kid sitting on the corner
Thinking about crossing the border
His daddy hits when he's not sober
and he just waits until it's over
Old man has got something to hide
Couldn't resist that social tide
He took away so many lives in prison
he just did what he ws told

And the band's been playing the sweetest song
and it makes me feel alright
But the music starts to fade away
into the secrets of the night I don't know

I get down on my feet with a desperate heart
Hit me with a stick if I'm making mistake
I don't mind what the people say
Maybe you've been thinking I'm a fucking moralist

A little insane singing in vave
That's the kind of man whom I really respect
Panciles in my hand and the words straight from th street
Stick them in a can and I throw it as a bomb

And the band's been playing the sweetest song
and it makes me feel alright
But the music starts to fade away
into the secrets of the night I don't know

A little insane singing in vave
The cops go rotten they're having a break
The panciles in my hand and
the words straight from th street
Stick them in a can and I throw it as a bomb

And the band's been playing the sweetest song
and it makes me feel alright
But the music starts to fade away
into the secrets of the night I don't know

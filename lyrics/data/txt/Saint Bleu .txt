Boy cries wolf
Never trust the mannequins looking out
As the exodus begins
I'm never sure
Going over every fact
Memories, or is this the hour to react?

On my knees
I don't expect any answers
But I believe what I believe
Underneath blue skies
On a perfect day

Spinning like a planet on my own
Gravity keeps the world from going cold
I always doubt everything that must remain
My friends laugh
But I can't recall their names

On my knees
I don't expect any answers
But I believe what I believe
Underneath these blue skies

If I fall asleep until
The next dream wakes me up in time
On a perfect day
Don't you ask yourself, "Can this be?"
The world won't last too long
On a perfect day

On my knees
I don't expect any answers
But I believe what I believe
Underneath these blue skies

If I fall asleep until
The next dream wakes me up in time
On a perfect day
Don't you ask yourself, "Can this be?"
The world won't last too long
On a perfect day

So I'm tearing it down
Look how it all comes down now
Gonna tear it down now
Gonna tear it down
Gonna tear it down now
Tear it all down

If I fall asleep until
The next dream wakes me up in time
On a perfect day
Don't you ask yourself, "Can this be?"
The world won't last too long
On a perfect day

Gonna tear it down
On a perfect day

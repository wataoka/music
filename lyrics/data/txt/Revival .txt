We walked a forest for a long time.
We passed each other with an owl.
That laughter of the animals.
I fired this gun many times.

We just went through a forest suddenly.
There is nothing dumbly here.
On the huge white stone.
We look like lost child's ant.

I felt nothing any more.
I'll stand as the flat world now.

I won't wait for a morning now.
As I just open my eyes.
I'm breathing like a machine.
What on earth happened to me?

d・e・l・i・g・h・t
s・a・d・n・e・s・s

I felt nothing any more.
I'll stand as the flat world now.

We found someone's footprint today.
My feeling moved after a long time.
This cruel world may be
the way everyone passes.
Can we start newly again?
Can we start newly again?

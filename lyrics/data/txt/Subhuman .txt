good bye
I must be leaving now
because Maybe,
I'm full of likes and dislikes
The noise on the street is unbearable
but Maybe,
I have got nowhere to go

so I wanna be a bat
and I want to touch the sun
I will try to force a smile

I cannot stand this heat
Please tell me
Where I am right now

I woke up at midnight again
oh baby
I did not know what to do next
I can't see,
but I can feel, all the time
oh baby
I have got nothing to lose

Just I wanna be a bat
and I want the shining star
I will try to force a cry

I cannot stand this heat
Please tell me
Where I am right now

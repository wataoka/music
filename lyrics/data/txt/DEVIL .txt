See the tears,falling on my green skin
I can feel the fear,it's always all around me

Everybody's doing fine,but I sit here suffering
Heavy is life,when it's painted with lies

I try not to hurt you,why do you hurt me?
Something's growing in your soul

Tryin'to look for an easy way out,but nothing's gonna change
You know your own Devil's gonna fly,so just let it go

Fly with your Devil's wing,to get one real thing
Look with your Devil's eyes, just don't miss your train
Fly with your Devil's wing,to get one real thing
Kiss with your Devil's lips,wake up your brain

Fly with your Devil

Fly with your Devil's wing,to get one real thing
Look with your Devil's eyes, just don't miss your train
Fly with your Devil's wing,to get one real thing
Kiss with your Devil's lips,wake up your brain

You try to raise your fist,but you're paralyzed
You try to scream to the end of the sky,but it's still a whisper

Fly with your Devil's wing,to get one real thing
Look with your Devil's eyes, just don't miss your train
Fly with your Devil's wing,to get one real thing
Kiss with your Devil's lips,wake up your brain

Fly with your Devil's wing
Fly with your Devil's wing

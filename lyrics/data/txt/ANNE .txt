My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Cause I found a true love
My little love song to you

My sweet baby, I can't move without you
My sweet baby, I got no groove without you
My sweet baby, I can't sing without you

You're the sunshine of my life
You're the apple of my eye
I can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time
Oh, Anne

Sweet little girl, I love having you around, baby
Sweet little girl, your love is driving me crazy
My sweet baby, your love sets my soul on fire
My sweet baby, you're my heart's desire

You're the one that makes me glad
You're the one that makes me sad
Gimme all the love you got
Gimme all the love you got

Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne

My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
I got you in my heart
My little love song to you

You're the sunshine of my life
You're the apple of my eye
I can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time
You're the one that makes me glad
You're the one that makes me sad
Gimme all the love you got
Gimme all the love you got

Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne, I love every little thing about you
Oh Anne, my baby, my sweet baby

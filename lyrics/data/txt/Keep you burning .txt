We burn the place down to the ground
Breaking the taboo and turn up the sound
Blasting away! Gonna shout it out loud!
Around the world to ignite the crowd
So many faces So many places
All things money can't buy
And now I came to realize
For a reason I'm here

Come whatever may
The sun will rise in your heart
Hold on to your dream never let it go by
Screaming loud and proud
Keep you burning for life
Don't just sit there waiting for chance
Reach out and grab it now for yourself
Praying for miracle to happen to you?
Only you can change your fate
So many faces So many places
All things money can't buy
And now I came to realize
For a reason I'm here

Come whatever may
The sun will rise in your heart
Hold on to your dream
Never let it go by
Screaming loud and proud
Keep you burning for life
Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout it out loud!

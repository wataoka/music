I can feel it coming over me
I feel it all around me
I've been waiting for this moment all my life it's my destiny
There's a fire deep inside of me
it's waiting to come out now
no matter what, no matter how, I know I'll make it through somehow

cuz when the road feels too long
I'll still be holding on
I'm gonna keep on going, I know I'll be strong(my faith is too strong)

[Chorus]
Indestructible
I wont let nobody break me down
Indestructible
nothings gonna stop me now
Indestructible
gonna gonna make gonna keep on going
Indestructible
the last man standing

I'm ready for whatever
I'm never giving up
nothing can break my spirit
cuz it's indestructible

can't explain it, it's incredible
the strength I feel inside me
nothing is impossible
I know I'll find my way
through a storm through the darkest night
whatever comes it's alright
Not gonna turn around I'm ready, for the future now

and when the road feels too long
I'll still be holding on
I'm gonna keep on going, I know I'll be strong

[Chorus]

Flo Rida Exile!
nothing can break my spirit
hey nothing can break my spirit, my spirit is too strong
indestructible nobody is taking over my throne
muscle my situation I'll make and do it alone
built from the ground up insider so I last long
the last man standing on the planet going wild
Flo Rida beat adversity making that exile
cause never know what emergency or trouble I just found
don't even bother hurting me feelings in the clouds
too hard for me to reach if I could it wouldn't matter
no helicopter plane or some new infinity ladder
I was born to contemplate
I'm a point with like a dagger
I mean no hard shit cause they on top of my platter!
So many times I heard they as loud as a bell
Cause I'm on the ground telling myself I can't fail
The bottom line my spirit is powerful not frail
That's all of me can't break it I'm loving it oh yeah

nothing is impossible
if you really want it
and I really want it
not gonna stop, no matter what, no
yeah this time, nothing can hold me back,
nothing can break me down, my spirit's indestructible

[Chorus]

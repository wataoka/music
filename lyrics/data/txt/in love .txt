just forget
all your worries,hey you'll be alright
until the sun comes up I will be by your side
baby I'm in love with you

I'm gonna surf down to the subway moving with the sleepy crowd everyday empty passion,
some conversations and the concrete's shining in the Tokyo morning

I wonder if you are dreaming about the night we met, sweet darling her phone is ringing, but she won't answer
what's on her mind I am always searching

things are still the same but my aim is now so really true and clear
can't you see that your hard days are over

just forget
all your worries,hey you'll be alright
until the sun comes up I will be by your side
baby I'm in love with you
you make me feel like I am the one for you
who can make your crazy dreams come true baby I'm in love with you

always trying to dive into your ocean but your cold smile breaks my notion
I wanna love your yesterdays,I bet i won't let you down yeah I see you in my future

things are still the same but my aim is now so really true and clear
looking up the skies and I realize the reason why I'm standing here
can't you see that your hard days are over

just forget
all your worries,hey you'll be alright
until the sun comes up I will be by your side
baby I'm in love with you
you make me feel like I am the one for you
who can make your crazy dreams come true baby I'm in love with you

just forget
all your worries,hey you'll be alright
until the sun comes up I will be by your side
baby I'm in love with you
you make me feel like I am the one for you
who can make your crazy dreams come true baby I'm in love with you

just forget
all your worries,hey you'll be alright
until the sun comes up I will be by your side
baby I'm in love with you

baby I'm in love with you

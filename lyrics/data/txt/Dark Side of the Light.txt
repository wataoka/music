My mixed emotions, where'd you come from?
Rolling soul is missing now

Don't you know?
Dark with light
Reflection... into you

Inside... discover me
I'm lost in the dark

Affection and hatred are living in everyone

Your inner feelings, where did you go?
Holding hearts together now

Oh, break through the dark
With dusk comes the truth
Let the world shine for you

Outside... show me whole love
Brightness! Capture you

The darkness and lightness are living in everyone

Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love
But we all hold gentle eyes
Find it!

Inside... discover me, please
Discover me
Don't forget Love!
No, we can't escape from the dark side of the light

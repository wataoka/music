War, one day if you deceased
No war everybody living in peace
Shelter for those who live inna di streets
Bad man go station and give in dem piece
Even though I know we live inna di belly a di beast
We fight one another then really we defeat
The purpose of life and it is
To live positive, so I
I'm starting with the man in the mirror

When me look inna di mirror
Is a man inna di mirror
Reflection shows me and Jah inna di mirror
And he said to me change the world I dare you
Speak up and let on one scare you
Spread love to those who come near you
Sing your song let the whole world hear you

If make a change and you make a change
Then one day there will be no wall
If I make a change and you make change
Then one day there will be no wall
(No wall) no wall (no wall) no warll (no wall)

It's gonna take you and me to make it right, make
it right
There is nothing that we can't do if we try, if we try

If I show love and you show love
Then we will all live in love
If I am loved and you are loved
There's nothing we can't rise above

If make a change and you make a change
Then one day there will be no wall
If I make a change and you make change
Then one day there will be no wall
(No wall) no wall (no wall) no warll (no wall)
There will be no wall
(No wall) no wall (no wall) no wall (no wall)
There will be no wall

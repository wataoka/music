Open your eyes, wake up my love
This is the calm I am speaking of
Empty and cold I am torn apart
You enter the beats back in my heart

I have arrived much too soon
I'm waiting for you to enter my room

This could be your love song
This could be your love song

I lie awake, this moonless night
Knowing our timing isn't right
Shadows of dreams cast from my soul
Without your light I'll never be whole

I have arrived much too soon
I'm waiting for you to enter my room

This could be your love song
This could be your love song

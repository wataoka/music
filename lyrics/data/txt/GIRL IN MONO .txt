So she whispers lightly
Says she feels alive here
Have I been here before?
Oh I just don't know yeah
And I watch her flicker
'til I realize that I'm only dreaming
And I keep repeating...

Send your monotone back to me
Send your monotone back to me
'Cause I don't think I can feel this way after you go

And she's slowly fading
As she light gets brighter
Will I ever see her?
Oh I just don't know yeah
And she smiles when I say
“Girl, you're all I'm needing”
Should have painted pictures with goodbye whispers

Send your monotone back to me
Send your monotone back to me
'Cause I don't think I can feel this way after you go
Send your monotone back to me
Send your monotone back to me
'Cause I don't think I can feel this way after you go

And if I call you out
Would you find your way back here and flicker like you do
And if I hold you tight and let you turn out the light
Would you keep me from waking up
'Cause that's when you're alive...
That's when you're alive...
And that's when I'm alive...
'Cause that's when you're alive...

Send your monotone back to me
Send your monotone back to me
'Cause I don't think I can feel this way after you go
Send your monotone back to me
Send your monotone back to me
'Cause I don't think I can feel this way after you go
You have to stay alive ...and give me life...

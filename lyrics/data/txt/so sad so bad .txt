「Under the blue sky in the darkness,
held close by the deep blue
In the heightened space,
exists a creature that just starts wriggling」

ah~ 真夜中の青空の下 深い青に抱かれながら
研ぎすまされた感覚の中 うごめき出す怪物が居る 今

wo~~~~that's him

so sad so, sensitive, so bad, so innocent, so shy, so breakble

that's him wo~~~~that's him

類い稀なる才能なんて 誰もかれも持ち合わせてる
鋭い痛みの中だけで つぼみを開く花があるから

wo~~~~that's him

so sad so, sensitive, so bad, so innocent, so shy, so breakble

that's him everybody has it.

Na na na~

「Under the blue sky in the darkness,
held close by the deep blue
In the heightened space,
exists a creature that just starts wriggling」

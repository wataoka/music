Again I want to tell my stories…
It's still running with me.
I can't hold my hand wave good bye.
I wanna live it up my life. It's my life.

Again I want to tell my stories…
It's still running with me.
I try to see the end of world,
but it is circle and round.

Can't find the way…
I hit the road to fame.
Can't find the way…
Yes, I got to straggle 'till I die.
Now, I know only I can change myself.

If you could find the way to reality.
Why don't you tell me how…
Nothing ventured, Nothing gained.
I wanna live it up my life.

Can't find the way…
I hit the road to fame.
Can't find the way…
Yes, I got to straggle 'till I die.
Now, I know only I can change myself.

Walk in the dark… In silent night…
All I can see is black and blue?
Someday it's rain. Someday it's snow.
But one day, sun will burn and shine on me.

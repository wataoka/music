That boy I respected Had childhood too
I find it moves me Maybe he, rode cool bike
With favourite song Laughing after school
Oh but it's just imagination I hope
That some things do not change
That some things do not change

Why cant's Why cant's well!?
Why cant's I don't know
what to do Why cant's
Why cant's well?
Why cant's I don't know

how to drive me Loveable,
dog named jack Grew up like me
I find I'm tearing Make merry ran after
Ball he wanted How he did love me
Oh but it's just imagination I hope
That some things do not change
That some things do not change

Why cant's Why cant's well!?
Why cant's I don't know
what to do Why cant's
Why cant's well?
Why cant's I don't know

how to drive me

Why cant's Why cant's well!?
Why cant's I don't know
what to do Why cant's
Why cant's well?
Why cant's I don't know

what to do Why cant's
Why cant's well!?
Why cant's I don't know
what to do I devote myself to life
Everybody must have heart Think well!
What do they thinkâ€¦?
Don't I know

Now I know that the truth
sometimes hides in the dark
Burning bright like a flame
Couldn't see who you are

Standing on solid ground
Light a flame, it's gonna take you higher
Passion strong, a savage warrior
Can't escape, I feel the heat from your fire

You're the one that I live for
You fight the fight each day, a lonely battle
When you're gone I only want you more
But you're oh so far away, please stay with me now
Tell me that you're feeling me, say the words I can't speak
Doesn't matter where you are I'm listening
You're the one that I live for
Keep fighting fighter, fighter, fighter, fighter

A feeling stronger than love
A battle that will be won
A story that will live on
forever and ever
A feeling stronger than love
A battle that will be won
A story that will live on

I miss you, wanna hold you
Gonna need you, everything you do
Upside down, I can feel your kiss
I'm gonna miss, I'm staring out of windows
It's the only way to fly high
and I feel the pressure but I never cry
'cause I know you'll be here for me
One & only, it's you
I loveyou so

Every time you go away
Deep inside, my heart is crying for you
but I'm never lonely 'cause you're coming back some day
Never stop, there's no doubt 'cause I believe in you

You're the one that I live for
Just close my eyes and I can feel the power
Run away but you just can't ignore
I feel your spirit grow, it lives deep inside me
Don't you ever lose the faith
We will see a better day
When you've lost your way it's time to start again
You're the one that I live for
A lonely fighter, fighter, fighter, fighter

Where are you from?
Where do you go?
Show me the way, I'll follow
I'm so confused
I can't deny wanna hide from the pain and sorrow
When you're feeling so low
I will be there for you just call my name I will know
You don't need a reason
When I think about you these feelings they grow
I love you more

You're the one that I live for
You fight the fight each day, a lonely battle
And I know that justice will endure
Long as you keep on fighting, keep on trying
They may beat you to the ground
And you think you can't go on
You will always find a way if you believe
You're the one that I live for
Keep fighting fighter, fighter, fighter, fighter

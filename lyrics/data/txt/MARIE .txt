Oh, Marie
Oh, Marie
You're the whispering wind
Let me hear your love to me

Can't you see
What a pleasant dream
Lovin' you is like a gleam
You always make my heart free

I've waited and waited
All of my life, I've been setting for you
So hold me and squeeze me
Tell me that you love me too

Oh, Marie
Please never leave me tonight
Oh, Marie
How I love you so tight

I've waited and waited
All of my life, I've been setting for you
So hold me and squeeze me
Tell me that you love me too

Oh, Marie
Never leave me, please
Oh, Marie
Ohâ€¦

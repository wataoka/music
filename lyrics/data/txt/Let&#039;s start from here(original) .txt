Giving up,why should I
we've come to far to forget
we're beautiful,we just got lost
somewhere along the way
so much was missing when you went away

CHORUS
Let's start from here,lose the past
change our minds, we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance not think too deep
of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
I don't care where we go
Let's start from here
Let's start from here

standing here face to face
a finger on your lips
don't say a word don't make a sound
silence surrounds us now
even when you were gone I felt you everywhere

CHORUS
I've never been the one to open up
but you've always been the voice within'
the only warmth for my cold heart

Let's start from here,lose the past
change our minds, we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance not think too deep
of all those promises
Let's start from here,lose the past
change our minds
we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance not think too deep
of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
I don't care where we go
Let's start from here...

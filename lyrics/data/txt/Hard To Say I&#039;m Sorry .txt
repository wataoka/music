Everybody need a little time away
I heard him say
From each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away
From each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise you
And after all been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

Couldon't stand to be kept away
Just for a day from your body
Wouldon't wanna be swept away
Far away from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise you
And after all been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise you
And after all been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise you
And after all been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

I can't let goâ€¦

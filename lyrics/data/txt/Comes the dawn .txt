Just like shadow needs light
Bliss exists with sorrow
To live is to face sadness
That you can't get away from
At a point in your life comes
A time of sheer misery
But please don't you be so afraid
The night will fade
Like the dawn breaks every morning
There's a ray of hope in the dark
'Cause no sorrow lasts forever
You will get through

Reach out and grab your fate
(No matter what they say)
Again the sun will rise
Reach out and grab your fate
(grab with your own hands)
Again the sun will rise
(And let yourself go)
You know all comes to an end
You never meet without parting
Seeking deep affection by hurting, hating, hitting
Life is lonely and isolated
In the end we're all alone
At a point in your life comes
A time you're lost all alone
But please don't you be so afraid
The night will fade
Like the dawn breaks every morning
There's a ray of hope in the dark
'Cause no sorrow lasts forever
You will get through

At a point in your life comes
A time of sheer misery
But please don't you be so afraid
The night will fade
Like the dawn breaks every morning
There's a ray of hope in the dark
'Cause no sorrow lasts forever
You will get through

Whatever comes your way
No matter what they say
(No matter what they say)
Just grab and hold it tight
(grab with your own hands)
The future will be bright
(And let yourself go)
Reach out and grab your fate
Again the sun will rise

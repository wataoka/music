I say you in my dreams
We were walking hand in hand
On a white sandy beach of Hawai'i
We were playing in the sun
We were having so much fun
On a white sandy beach of Hawai'i

Sound of the ocean soothes my restless soul
Sound of the ocean rocks me all night long

Those hot long summer days
Lying there in the sun
On a white sandy beach of Hawai'i

Sound of the ocean soothes my restless soul
Sound of the ocean rocks me all night long

Last night in my dream
I say your face again
We were there in the sun
On a white sandy beach of Hawai'i

uh,uh I'm coming
Blood lad...
It's time to show up

Tell me how come I feel like this...
I could find a light of hope
Now I don't need a reason why
It's about time I need to go

Even if I last my way
my blood shows me how I live
I don't know if I can make it
But I don't care what they say

No matter what other people say,I'll do it my way
This is da way of "Blood Lad" This is how we do

I don't wanna regret again
And I know what I want 
I'm not the person I used to be
Wanna tryna finish it off for my life

You're the only person
who changed me like this
I'm not the person I used to be
Wanna tryna finish it off for your life

I don't want this to happen again
I don't want to do this again
I don't want to look back
I don't lose it again

No matter waht other people say,I'll do it my way
Because I decided to go my own way

I don't wanna regret again
And I know what I want
I'm not the person I used to be
Wanna tryna finish it off for my life

You're the only person
who changed me like this
I'm not the person I used to be
Wanna tryna finish it off for your life

It's time to show up
I can't ignore what I see
It's about time I need to go
It's time to show up
I can't ignore what I see
It's about time I need to go
This is da way of "Blood Lad"
You know this is how I do
This is my life!!

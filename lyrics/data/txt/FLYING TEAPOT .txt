Sometimes I think, oh yes I'd move to
Where all the shooting stars are gone
With all of our wishes

How could they bear, oh no, to carry
around the stupid human hopes
So I'm gonna help, I will !

Give me a key to lock
The door to the secret paradise
There are so many queuing up
And I won't let them in 
Look at them
They are cheeky
They are never worthy to be saved

Sometimes I feel oh yes, I could do
Almost everything I wanted
And It makes me cry

Lay your heart, lay your soul
Upon my magic carpet
Now we flying
To Venus just to kill time for tea, OK?
Remember, surrender
There's nothing you can do 'cause
Love's such a joke
Like a little Jack-in-the-box, You know

A little jack-in-the-box

Lay your heart, lay your soul
Upon my magic carpet
Now we flying
To Venus just to kill time for tea, OK?
Remember, surrender
There's nothing you can do 'cause
Love's such a joke
Like a little Jack-in-the-box, You know

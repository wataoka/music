And here we are tonight
Two flames alight
Who burn within the darkness as shadows dance
The moment melts into our arms
As we slip on the shores of eternity 

And here we are at last
The storm has passed
We waltz upon the water, the wind has calmed
And so we glide into each other's eyes
As time becomes a sea of eternity 

And now I know that I have been
To desire's depth as in a dream
A sunken boat is all I'll ever own
For drowning hearts make perfect stones 

And so, here we are tonight
The thieves of light
Whose dance is but a voyage beneath those distant stars
The moment melts into our arms
As we stand on the shores of eternity

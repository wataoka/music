I'm looking for blue rainy sky
I'm looking for such nice one day yeah!
I seem to wash all away
A red umbrella seems to become you

I'm looking for the future at darkness (Feel my way)
Of the degree that doesn't become sentimental is moderate
I'm looking for the reason
While laughing at now

I'm looking for rainy sky
I'm looking for the colorful season
I'm rocking on your heart and your body yeah!
I looked too much for it and have been so tired

I'm looking for blue rainy sky (In my life)
I seem to wash all away
Will not there be any good method…
You and me…I will find out each other

I'm looking for rainy sky
I'm looking for the colorful season
I'm rocking on your heart and your body yeah!
I looked too much for it and have been tired

If I look for my good point and look for your wonderful point,
I noticed that rainy sky was so wow splendid when I did so it.

I'm looking for rainy sky
I'm looking for the colorful season
I'm rocking on your heart & body yeah!

I'm just now, searching for clear days, loving' in forever

I'm the one who make me see the morning sun
I'm the one who make me stand still on the ground

I can swim in the ocean
I can fly in the sky
I won't drown or fall anymore
Cos I'm not scared

I'm the moon of the night, shining thorough my eyes
I'm the beautiful rain when my heart is dry

And I know there's no one
I can trust anymore
I don't need love
Cos love disappears

Even when the cold winds would fill the sky
I won't shed my tears
Cos I forget how to cry

I can swim in the ocean
I can fly in the sky
Not afraid of drowning or falling
Cos I don't have anything to lose

ただ一人寂しく悲しい夜は
帽子を片手に外へ出て見れば

青空に輝く月の光に
心の悩みは消えて跡もなし

仰げば空には 冴えわたる月が
ああ 三日月の夜
青空に輝く月に光に

心の悩みは消えて跡もなし

When you're all alone any ole night
And you're feeling out of tune
Pick up your hat and close up your flat
Get out and get under the moon

Look, look, look at those stars above,
Ah look, look, look at those sweeties love!
Oh boy, give me a night in June
I really mean it!

All you've gotta do any old night,
When you're feeling out of tune
Pick up your hat and close up your flat
Get out and get under the moon

Get out and get under the moon

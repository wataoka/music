I like to rock baby
I like to move baby
Can u make me go crazy?
Is this too much for u boy?
Watch me just do my thing
Sit down let me begin
Get what u been missing
Might be too much for u girl

I know u want me
But I don't know if
I should let you in
Ooh can u handle me

Oh girl don't worry
I'm more than u think
Soon as u try me
You'll never ever let me go

Can u give me everything I need?
Can I trust u?
Are you made to please a girl?
Have u ever had a real true man like me
Who had u lose your mind
and then make u go all night. Girl

I want somebody
Who can make me be a lady!
Knows how to treat me
Who my mind and body

How much do you need?
How much should I give?
Can u take all of me?
Should I really make u lose control?

Can u give me more than I dreamed of?
Can I trust u? Can u make me feel so good?
Have u ever had a night that never ends?
I'm gonna give u a chance
Receive it with two hands. Girl

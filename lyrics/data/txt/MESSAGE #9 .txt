Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
Soul to soul
I will say never again
Remember now

Omoidaite ima
Remember now
The dream you had
Before you were born
The dream that has died out

Carry your heart to where you sense the cry comes from
Carry your heart till the end


Come and touch the feel of the heat going throu' my mind
Come and touch and don't be scared
If it's bleeding

Carry your heart to where you sense the cry comes from
Carry your heart till the end

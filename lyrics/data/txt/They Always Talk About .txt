言わないことのもどかしさ 言い過ぎる愚かさ
廻って巡る時の 麻酔 弱さ
遠い国のこと話して お金について話して (明日について話して)
彼はずっと昔の恋人の話をしている

I was walking around in my footsteps,and no one's there
The sun has come up but you're lying there
You gotta swallow it up,once you see the dish of 2 sides in 1
Melting on my face,my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see
Melting on my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see

完全なる家族の感覚 はかりにかけてみても
傾くことはなくて - 夢を見た

And they always talk about connections
And they always talk about the surface
And she always talks about her boyfriend
And he always talks about his ex-girlfriend

I was walking around in my footsteps,and no one's there
The sun has come up but you're lying there
You gotta swallow it up,once you see the dish of 2 sides in 1
Melting on my face,my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see
Melting on my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see

You could give me more information I need

Oh I'm not giving it up cuz I know
there's gotta be someone here
Walk the detours,I don't care
I talk to you,”everything
that I wanna say or do is make it real”
Just like my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see
Melting on my face,my eyes,and everything that I see

I was walking around in my footsteps,and no one's there
The sun has come up but you're lying there
You gotta swallow it up,once you see the dish of 2 sides in 1
Melting on my face,my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see
Melting on my ears,my eyes,and everything that I see

How do you find when you just don't know?
How do you search when you just don't know?
How do you love when you just don't know?

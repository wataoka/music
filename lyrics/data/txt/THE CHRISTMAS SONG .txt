Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Jack Frost nippin' at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
will find it hard sleeping tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
an' goodies on his sleigh

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know
how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninety-two

Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you!

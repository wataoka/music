You shy boy Don't be afraid
In your book what does it say to you?
Easy easy easy does it
You just have to love who you are

Day by day Things are all messed up
All we need is cakes and ale and everlasting laugh
Face our faith It'll be all right
Hesitate no more We'll be fine Let's throw them all on fire
Hey shy girl Don't shed no tears

In your song what does it say to you?
Easy easy easy does it
You just have to enjoy who you are

Day by day Things are all messed up
All we need is cakes and ale and everlasting laugh
Face our faith It'll be all right
Hesitate no more We'll be fine Smash the radio
Hey girl let's smash the radio

Day by day Things are all messed up
All I need is cakes and ale and everlasting laugh
Day by day Things are all messed up
All we need is cakes and ale and everlasting laugh
Face our faith It'll be all right
Hesitate no more We'll be fine Smash the radio
Hey man let's throw them all on fire

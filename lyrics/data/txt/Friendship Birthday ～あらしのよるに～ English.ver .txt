Everything will be alright just believe in me
If I have you here with me then your smile is all I need
You and I on that day, that place together
Standing so high reaching the sky, felt the rushing wind of tomorrow

Can you feel it? My hand on your hand Overflowing courage and love
Feel the best synchronize, and our hearts harmonize
Lifting me high above into the blue sky and beyond

I looked around the world and found the only,
my one and only precious treasure,
Now that I've got you I've learned to believe in us.
Believe in the power together forever
I felt a quiet touch a miracle from my heart on a magical stormy night

I took a journey to find a four-leaf clover
Hoping the sign of luckiness, will bring happiness
Everyday is an ordinary day in life
But there's a beauty underneath In everything you are feeling

I can see it, when I close my eyes so clearly you smile to me
In my heart burns a light, guiding me safe to the night
And I will hold you tight don't be afraid and fear no more

Far and far away our future lies ahead,
it may seem so endless but we must fly
We can dream a dream and wish together,
and picture the future it's easier together
Nothing can break this friendship I realize this tonight
on a magical stormy night

I looked around the world and found the only,
my one and only precious treasure,
Now that I've got you I've learned to believe in us.
Believe in the power together forever
I felt a quiet touch a miracle from my heart on a magical stormy night

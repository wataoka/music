She turned her nightlight on and blew him a kiss
He stared back with green crayola eyes
She traced his likeness from the back of the disk
Next to a promise of the biggest prize

She's joining a fanclub with her friends
Fillin' her bathtub with t-shirts and eight by tens
He looks dreamy, she's in love from afar
When she's pickin' up a fallen star

Downstairs the late show's got "The Age of the Rock"
The Monk's on from last Sunday at the Milky Way
Mom's writin' checks to the priest on the tube singin'
Dig down deep
Cuz, if you wanna get to heaven all you gotta do is pay to pray

She's joining a fanclub with her friends
Fillin' her bathtub with holy water and amens
He looks dreamy, she's in love from afar
When she's pickin' up a fallen star

She's joining a fanclub with her friends
Fillin' her bathtub with t-shirts and eight by tens
He looks dreamy, she's in love from afar
Pickin' up a fallen star

Shake that woody
For me Saint Pinnochio
You've made your money
Now watch that money grow

She's joining a fanclub with her friends
Fillin' her bathtub with t-shirts and eight by tens
He looks dreamy, she's in love from afar
When she's pickin' up a fallen star

Joining a fanclub
Big Mistake
I still get heartburn
Thinkin' of the stamps I ate
How I loved him
Before fate crashed his car
Say a prayer for a fallen star
A wish for a fallen star

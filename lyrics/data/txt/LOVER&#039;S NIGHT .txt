Pale Moonlight A lover's night
And we're walkin hand in hand together
A sweet caress A tender kiss
It's just a way of showing our emotion

So many times we wondered if we'd ever…
Find a way to keep our love forever
Maybe now… we can leave our tears behind

Close my eyes That use to cry
Thinking about the way we use  to hurt each other
Jealous hrarts can't be as one
Now that we are strong
We can see it thru
Just me and you

Lover's night Lovely night
And the two of us romancin
Lovely night Lover's night
And the feeling's got me dancin
So from now on We'll carry on
And leave our tears behind

You and I Condle light
Quiet evenings spent alone together
A sweet Caress A tender kiss
Feel the magic of our strong emotion
My love is true

Lover's night Lovely night
And the two of us romancin
Lovely night Lover's night
And the feeling's got me dancin
So from now on We'll carry on
And leave our tears behind

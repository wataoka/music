Wind chimes whisper soft and sweet
Though there's not a hint of a breeze
Moonlight dancing on the garden walk
As it gently drifts through the trees

Romance take flight on this perfect night
While all of the world lay sleeping
Find us here as we feel the moment of love
Draw near

Dream sleep with your hand in mine
Underneath a blanket of stars
Song birds singing in a distant glade
As we share the warmth of the dawn

Let go of yourself
Free your mindset

no time to waste
but make your pace
it's OK to remove copy and paste
I'm doing my way
you do it your way
don't just follow your left find the right way
stereotypes
too many hypes
but I'm the epitome of new types
having the fear is power to my soul
cuz I overcome them
that's how I roll

expose your thoughts
don't be afraid of making mistakes
rules prevailing in
(somethings that you cannnot run away)
that may be your greatest rival
believe in faith and your heart
your true soul stop being
(you must face yourself sooner or later)
in the shades come on
out in the open sun

Beauty of the child of destiny
delightful days
are with rich density of love
thorny path
there's no easy way for real bliss
so I keep on fighting for
beauty of destiny

stand up and fight for your delight
lose sometimes but a cry is worth a dime to shine
(noone wins it all no oh)
don't let one loss shut your lights down

extra coated with nice, hot syrup
my sweet flows make my life stirred up
I like to keep this fire so flared up
reasons I gotta fight but cheer up
taste of fear is taste of life
take for granted then you might taste the nightmares
be careful not to get impaired
have faith in what you do here and there
this age went from local to global to glocal
so called lifestyle evolved
beauty of change in time I revolve around it
this era I'm so involved
a lot nonsense did provoke me to write
and it got me so deep, changed my life
still struggling but keep the fist tight
mostly against me, my life

times you win times you lose
times you smile times you frown
times,
every moment's add'n'multiple of life
(each sec counts, they mount to something)
at times you vision
times you're blinded
times you listen
times you can't hear what your heart really says
(you need to focus, don't be fooled, by it)
in flow of city

Just let go of yourself
Free your mindset

times you win
times you lose
but at times you gotta bring the king's ring
so follow the flow of century like twitter
prepare for the moment then be a heavy hitter
my voice is heard now even when I whisper
but I had to earn it the right to glitter
Mr. L to the J keeping it Mr. swagger right

Beauty of the child of destiny
delightful days
are with rich density of love
thorny path
there's no easy way for real bliss
so I keep on fighting for
beauty of destiny

Beauty of the child of destiny
delightful days
are with rich density of love
thorny path
there's no easy way for real bliss
so I keep on fighting for
beauty of destiny
gonna keep on fighting for beauty of destiny

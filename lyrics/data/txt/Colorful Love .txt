IT'S NOT FANTASY...
WHAT CAN THIS TRULY BE...
AND I THINK IT IS DESTINY...
I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY...

WHEN I THINK OF YOU...
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO...
AND WHAT IS REALLY TRUE...
I LOVE YOU MORE EVERY DAY

Baby I gotta say
モノクロの世界
色鮮やかに
染まる景色

いつもより
少しだけ違う
この恋が特別だって
Don't you know baby??

IT'S NOT FANTASY...
WHAT CAN THIS TRULY BE...
AND I THINK IT IS DESTINY...
I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY...

WHEN I THINK OF YOU...
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO...
AND WHAT IS REALLY TRUE...
I LOVE YOU MORE EVERY DAY

ずっと前に
触れた事のある
この感覚
不思議なほど

どれくらい昔から君を
探し続けてきたのだろう…
And I want to tell you baby

IT'S NOT FANTASY...
WHAT CAN THIS TRULY BE...
AND I THINK IT IS DESTINY...
I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY...

WHEN I THINK OF YOU...
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO...
AND WHAT IS REALLY TRUE...
I LOVE YOU MORE EVERY DAY

胸の中に抱いたmystery
夢の中に描いた奇跡
必然と分かっているけれど
信じられない
You will always be here with me

IT'S NOT FANTASY...
WHAT CAN THIS TRULY BE...
AND I THINK IT IS DESTINY...
I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY...

WHEN I THINK OF YOU...
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO...
AND WHAT IS REALLY TRUE...
I LOVE YOU MORE EVERY DAY

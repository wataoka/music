You can call my name
(You might lose your luck)
Whenever you're feeling down and blue
You don't know how to smile
I know how hard it is
I'll make you feel alright
I remember the day I sat with you in this corner

Alone in front of you
Oh! I don't know the words
Because anywhere is your home
Your sweet home
No matter where you are
This thing it's home
It's incredible
All my friends came home again
Sometimes you can not avoid the heavy snow
as long as you're alive

I touched your feeling inside
You're shifting in my eyes
Drifting away
Don't get stuck in sorrow
Get over the things from the past
I'll watch your back

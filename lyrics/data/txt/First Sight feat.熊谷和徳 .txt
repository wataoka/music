Suddenly that flew into my eyes
Even I can never touch it with my hands
Now I'm just standing without words and looking for the lines that great people said

My heart is beating faster than I thought
Even you are like an evil in the heaven
Now I'm just pretending that I'm OK
Maybe you are playing with my feeling

If you whisper something, however it's not to me,
My body starts shaking automatically

I'll never stop and I'll never mind,
Already I've fallen in love with you, every night I wanna hold you tight
Let me touch your heart
I'll never stop and I'll never mind,
Already I've fallen in love with you, every night I wanna hold you tight
Let me touch your heart

On and on....everybody"say"come on
Just I'm thinking about you, singing about you tonight

Suddenly that flew into my eyes
Oh it's shining more than a bright stone
I was like a pierrot with a tiger, I tried to dance to hide it inside of me

If you whisper something, however it's not to me,
My body starts shaking automatically

I'll never stop and I'll never mind,
Already I've fallen in love with you, every night I wanna hold you tight,
Let me touch your heart.
I'll never stop and I'll never mind,
Already I've fallen in love with you, every night I wanna hold you tight,
Let me touch your heart.

On and on....everybody"say"come on
Just I'm thinking about you, singing about you tonight

I fall in love with you first sight

I fall in love with you first sight

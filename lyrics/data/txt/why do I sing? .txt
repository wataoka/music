why do I sing?
I have been singing while asking myself.

Music is a gift from God.
The world with beautiful misic, just like a prayer.

People starts to open their hearts, even whose soul is weary.
I will hold everything in this world with music.
I believe I was given this voice to spread a message of Love.
That's why I'm here and singing today and I will keep singing.

A small portion of love.
Music can hold everything in this world.
I believe I have this voice.

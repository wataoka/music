Dark night in the wind
calling softly
&quot;Give your soul to me&quot;
It's so easy

Beating of your heart
Has no rhythm
You don't have to fight
with this heart

※If you believe....
　If you have true love
　You can be free of fear
　You should just take a chance
　Shadows will fade away
　There's never anything
　To hold you back
　Underneath city lights

★Into the night
　Fear's the limit
　Into the night
　Faith will bring you
　Into the night
　Fear's the limit
　Into the night
　Heart beats strongly

Standing all alone
Hear the promise
Silent in the dawn
It is for you

Destiny or chance
Deep in your heart
You've all seen this place
Once before

City ever wakeful
There's no slumber
Your dreams wait for you here
They will come true for you
Streets under the stars
Look at the happiness
In city life
This can be paradise

Into the night
Fear's the limit
Into the night
Faith will bring you

Into the night
Fear's the limit
Into the night
Heart beats strongly

The sun went below the sea.
Some sea gulls are flying in the air.
The skies were gray throughout the day.

We kept late hours.
But 'All is well that ends well'
My car was fast and soon
got ahead of the other cars.
I met you on the street.
Will you put the mirror straight?
I want freedom to do what I like.
I told you so.
What do you want?

All the people of the earth
want to rock and roll.
I quit forgot. yes.
I'll try to do better in future.
All the people of the earth
want to rock and roll.
I will do it yet.
I felt my heart beating wildly.
What do you want?

The barking of the dog.
I had a keen pain in the head.
Winter is just around the corner.
Do you know how this feel?
I'm hold like a prisoner.
But I am not so sick that
I can't get well.
Just hold my breath.
What do you want?

All the people of the earth
want to rock and roll.
I quit forgot. yes.
I'll try to do better in future.
All the people of the earth
want to rock and roll.
I will do it yet.
I felt my heart beating wildly.
What do you want?

I want freedom to do what I like.

I'll have sherbet.

I gotta tell you this again today.
It's just too hard for me to keep in.
Every momen' just flyin' away
When I am with you.

Today must be my day,you know,we got together.
そうね あたしも会いたかったの、こんなキラキラ眩しい日だもの
You gotta special gift that makin' me feel so special.
そうなの、ホントに?それはあなたよ あなたに会うの嬉しくって
We,busy bees have must do's and have to go's.
今日は夜まで一緒でしょ? きいて、話したいこと一杯なのよ

Tell me about it and wish me not to be lost.
最近なんだか落ち着かないし、自分の居場所が不安になるの
I can see what you're sayin' it happened to me,too.
だったらわかる? なんとなく憂鬱、雨を待ったり、風を聴いたり
And say "So that's that" before you go to bed,right?
(ウン)やっぱり、あなたも? それで羊を数えるの?

Even I can enjoy your sensuous lies.
Maybe we are playin' hide-and-seek.
I love lookin' in your curious eyes.
You may be makin' a tongue-in-cheek.
I never can count you out from my life.
'Cause you are my fatal music

Remember,(I)got a super impression
When I saw you were runnin' to me.
I scented only your sweet expression.
All over me there.

Look,stick to your own road. You are you,though.
あたし自身、どうしたいのか 全然見えなくなっちゃって
You know,you areblessed whether you know it or not.
ウワァ! あなたがそう言うと ホントみたいに聞こえるわ
Life's passin' in a mad flurry. We can't waste our time.
しらけてなんていらんないし、落ち込んでるのは勿体ないし

When I'm with you time goes by awfully fast.
あなた知ってた? 時間はね加速してるの、少しづつ
So many things we don't knowin this whole wide world.
なんでも大事なことはみんな かなり知ってるつもりなのにね
We may never know what even we do not know.
解んないこと一杯あるって、知っていなくちゃいけないのかなァ

Even I can enjoy your sensuous lies.
Maybe we are playin' hide-and-seek.
I love lookin' in your curious eyes.
You may be makin' a tongue-in-cheek.
I never can count you out from my life.
'Cause you are my fatal music

Don't you think that you have to change your ways,huh?
あたしは自分を変えらんない 別に変える気もないし
You should have pride to be yourself,surely.
あたし自信を持ちたいな あたしはあたしなのってね
Yap,you gonna get off with your bad self later.
自分をもっと好きになりたい あなたのこと好きなくらいに

You can make it though. Everythin' has a reason to be.
こうして心が彷徨ってるのは、運命みたいな理由があるの?
As you can't change your fate you can change your attitude.
あなたの言うことがみえてきた あたしを思っていてくれるのね?
Why you think I wear GQ? I give you my best shot.
ほんと、ありがと! いつでもあなたはあたしのスノードロップね

Remember,(I)got a super impression
When I saw you were runnin' to me.
I scented only your sweet expression.
All over me there.

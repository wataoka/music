We are in motion, human ocean, to a new shore
A generation, house of nations, that's what we are

We speak the same rhythm
We talk but not with words
When we dance we send a message to the world

O swing the soulhouse round
We will bring the whole house down
We are one and we are also millions now

O we are brothers, we are sisters, of a new world
We'll last forever, we are rhythm, it is our turn

O there are no borderlines
In the colours of our eyes
Just this common rhythm running through our lives

this is where our hearts are born
At the centre of the storm
With emotions that you've never felt before

We speak the same rhythm
We talk but not with words
When we dance we send a message to the world

this is where our hearts are born
At the centre of the storm
With emotions that you've never felt before

We will bang the drums out loud
We will stand out in the crowd
We are one but we are also millions now

We speak the same rhythm
We talk but not with words
When we dance we send a message to the world

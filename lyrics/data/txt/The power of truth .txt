Black box sealed tight
Wonder what's inside
Suicidal martyr mission
Who fuels their pride?
Poverty breeding terror
Have-nots in rage
There's no way out of the evil trap
Who's behind it all?

How long can we stand?
Eternal domination
Shutting our eyes to the reality
The truth will see through
No bloodshed will pursue
The power of truth disavow violence
War machine, mean green ...
The world's playing their game
The dominator and the ruler
They're never to be blamed
Invisible kings Pulling the strings
Manipulation of mass
They write the book of history without soiling their hands
How long can we stand?
Eternal domination
Shutting our eyes to the reality
The truth will see through
No bloodshed will pursue
The power of truth disavow violence

How long can we stand
Eternal domination
Shutting our eyes to the reality
The truth will see through
No bloodshed will pursue
The power of truth disavow violence

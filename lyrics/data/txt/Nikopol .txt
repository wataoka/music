The ground below my feet" elevated
Instinctively programmed there for me
No thoughts my visions clear not too complicated
I'm here because you're here
(You've got a problem now)

The speck of fear grows in your eyes
You'll meet your death in no disguise
It may come as a small surprise
There will be no compromise for you

No problem can't be solved temporarily
Then soon it gets forgotten that you exist
Sounds echo underground nauseating
I'm here because you're here
(You've got a problem now)

The speck of fear grows in your eyes
You'll meet your death in no disguise
It may come as a small surprise
There will be no compromise for you

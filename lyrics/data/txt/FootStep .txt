I think when it was that you are in the shake of my heart
the word which isn't know was always applying
and traveling inside of the head
Even that tears becomes light further
and that feelbecome light further
Please don't trouble me Please give a tight hug
Why do I cry on your chest?

It it that such sad time comes!
I was lonely and lost my way
One drop of love feel between your fingers I dyered

It was discoverd in the lip
A blue sky and a soft look
I marely gaze at you. without using word
Your footstep sound in my heart
Why does night come to me?
Heart is buried darkness
I marely gaze at you. without using word
Your footstep sound in my heart

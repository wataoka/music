奏でる雨 さしのばした
大きな傘がひとつ うちとけてく この音とともに
近づけば行く ありったけの愛を抱えた月
思いは徨く この雨とともに

Oh Let tears slip through
your 2 fingers tonight
your 2 fingers tonight
Then why I can loving all yourself with pride.
香りに包まれた言葉 嗅いでみる

Oh Let tears slip through
your 2 fingers tonight
your 2 fingers tonight
Then why I can loving all yourself with pride.
For today it's Good-bye むせかえることもなく眠る

Oh Let tears slip through
your 2 fingers tonight
your 2 fingers tonight
Then why I can loving all yourself with pride.
香りに包まれた言葉 嗅いでみる

Oh Let tears slip through
your 2 fingers tonight
your 2 fingers tonight
Then why I can loving all yourself with pride.
For today it's Good-bye むせかえることもなく眠る

There no words. Good-bye

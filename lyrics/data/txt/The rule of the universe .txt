Nothing I wanna tell
And it is not necessary to say
Such as nature
It is significant to be there, but no words

About the meaning of being born
It is nonsense to think about
If you have a time to think about such a thing.
Let's climb the mountain

Nothing I wanna tell
And it is not necessary to say
Such as nature
It is significant to be there, but no words

It's not like a gamble
If you take a step forward
Definitely you will reach the top of the mountain

Let's get on the flow, which is the rule of the universe
Keep moving, otherwise you fail to keep up with the moment

The more you distress, the more you get the answer
How to climb, how to walk, how to get on the flow

We are, we are getting closer

Nothing I wanna tell
And it is not necessary to say
Such as nature
It is significant to be there, but no words

We are getting closer to the way out
We are getting closer to the way out
Closerâ€¦

The rule of the universe

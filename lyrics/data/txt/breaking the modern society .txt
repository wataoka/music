It is already a limit. Does nobody notice it?
This world is screams now.
So I break it.

I know it that all about you. Can you understand that I want to say.
I was fed up with you who liked a rule of the world.

Don't you know feedom, do you?
Here does not have a rule.
The truth always glistens and help out your sin.

(Your lie, lie, departure) Break it, break it and disturb all.
(Your lie, lie, departure) Give me, give me and learning and following.
(Your lie, lie, departure) Break it, break it and disturb all.
(Your lie, lie, departure) Satisfaction.

I intend to catch this broken world in this hand.
I destroy all and intend to star it again.

Don't you know freedom, do you?
Here does not have a rule.
The truth always glistens and help out your sin.

(Shout up!! Shout up!! Shout up!!) Son of a bxxch. Wake up mother fxxker.
(Shout up!! Shout up!! Shout up!!) Make light of me.

(Your lie, lie, departure) Break it, break it and disturb all.
(Your lie, lie, departure) Give me, give me and learning and following.
(Your lie, lie, departure) Break it, break it and disturb all.
(Your lie, lie, departure) Distraction.

I intend to catch this broken world in this hand.
I destroy all and intend to star it again.
I intend to catch this broken world in this hand.
I destroy all and intend to star it again.

It is finally the night is awakening

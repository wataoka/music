A long while I waited
Too much time I wasted
Tried to figure out the way
To break this frozen silence

I wish that I was bare naked
Because my own truth I shaded
So I didn't have to say
Anything to hurt you

Sometimes your kindness kills me
You look me in the eyes
But you're already gone
So you had to tell a lie

I didn't wanna die anymore and
I didn't wanna be your burden
I guess I won't be able to take it
And I know
You didn't wanna make me cry and
You didn't wanna say goodbye
So I said it for you

Tell me was there any other way

When you became so jaded
Everything stopped and faded
You took the future in your hand
And I got the past you left behind

You never talk about it
Just keep it in your heart and hide it
So you don't have to say
Anything to hurt me

Sometimes your kindness confuses me
I hear you call my name
But you're not even here
So you had to tell a lie

I didn't wanna die anymore and
I didn't wanna be your burden
I guess I won't be able to take it
And I know
You didn't wanna make me cry and
You didn't wanna say goodbye
So I said it for you

Tell me was there any other way

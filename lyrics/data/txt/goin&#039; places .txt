You may be tired but you know you're goin' places yet
To settle down now you'd be crazy 'cause you're makin' it

You make it sound like things are comin' at you a mile a minute
When actually it is just you movin' all alone.

Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
Yeah things are goin' down

You take your time at calculatin' speculatin' and
You think you're sly but somehow they don't seem to give a damn

No need to worry 'cause you're on your own terms now so live it
Yeah.. like a champion you lead the way. No goin' home.

You're sayin', You're fallin', You're callin' out.
You're sayin', You're fallin', You're breakin' down.
You're sayin', You're fallin', You're freakin' out.
You're sayin', You're fallin', But you'll make it out.
(I don't wanna see it fall down, I don't wanna see myself fall down)

Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
Yeah things are goin' down

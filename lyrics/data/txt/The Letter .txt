Give me a ticket for an airplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm going home
My baby just wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I got to spend
Got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone
I'm going home
My baby, just wrote me a letter

Well she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister, can't you see I have to get back
To my baby wants me home
Anyway

Give me a ticket for an airplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm going home
My baby just wrote me a letter

Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister , can't you see I have to get back
To my baby wants me home
Anyway

Give me a ticket for an airplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm going home
My baby just wrote me a letter

All these things I've learnt
They'll pass right through me when I'm on my way
All the souls I've burnt
They'll soon forget me when I go away

And I'll hear you calling
And I will know your name
I'm so scared of departing
But I will go all the same

All the shame I've had
学んだものの全て、掻いた恥の全て

It won't stay with me when I'm on my way
旅立ちの時には残らないだろう

So don't look so sad
そんなに悲しい面影を見せずに

I won't forget you as I go away
手を放しても君の笑みを浮かべたいの

Fall in your eyes
I'm caught in the sun
I turn away
Lose in your game
I burst into flame
I'm in your way

So How can you say that you want to be
I find your face
Your face
So How can you stay into my eye
I don't want to get away
Get away

I find myself
Inside of you
I scare myself
Burning inside

I find myself
Inside of you
I scare myself
Burning inside

You'll face yourself
Deep in my mind
Now erase your self
Frozen inside

Nothing at all
There's nowhere left to go
Fall apart

Melting alone looking down
And I'm closer to you

Coming closer
I swear I know you

Hole in the sky
I stare at the bright light
in your eyes
Howl in the dark
I crawl on the ground
I'm on a way

So How can I say not to dream bout you
Fly on your way
Your way
So How long you can last inside
Now There's something in the way
In The way

I find myself
Inside of you
I scare myself
Burning inside

I find myself
Inside of you
I scare myself
Burning inside

All by myself
Bleeding for you
Don't break apart
I'm sick of you

Crossing the line
with no pause
Going over again

Slipping away from myself
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you
to come through

I've been waiting for you
to come through

Listen as...

Listen as your day unfolds
challenge what your future holds
Try to keep your head up to the sky
Lovers they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears
Stand up and be counted, don't be shame to cry

You gotta be
You gotta be bad. You gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser. You gotta be hard
You gotta be tough. You gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day.

Herald what your mother said
Read the books your father read
Try to solve the puzzle in your own sweet time
Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view
My oh my, yeah...

You gotta be bad. You gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser. You gotta be hard
You gotta be tough. You gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day.

Time asks no questions, it goes on without you
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace
The world keeps on spinning, can't stop it if you tried to
The best part is danger staring you in the face
Oh...remember

Listen as your day unfolds
challenge what your future holds
Try to keep your head up to the sky
Lovers they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears
My oh my, yeah...

You gotta be bad. You gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser. You gotta be hard
You gotta be tough. You gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day.

You gotta be bad. You gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser. You gotta be hard
You gotta be tough. You gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day.

Got to be bold, Got to be bad
Got to be wise. Don't ever be cold
Got to be hard. Not too, too hard
All I know is love will save the day

You gotta be bad. You gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser. You gotta be hard
You gotta be tough. You gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together

You gotta be bad. You gotta be bold
You gotta be wiser. You gotta be hard
You gotta be tough. You gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together

All I know, all I know, love will save the day.

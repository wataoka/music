Take me
Some place
Why don't you talk to me come out to play?

Someone feed me now
Mammy's a liar
Keeps me hungry
Don't know reason why
Daddy's on trial
Say no joke

Nobody's home
In the last of sunny day
How can I back to my school?
'Cos nobody's home
In the last of sunny day
But then I'd like to see you

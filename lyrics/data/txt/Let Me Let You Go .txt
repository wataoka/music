Drove by your house today
Wondering how you were
I know you think of me
We can't just be a blur
Thought I saw a sign that said do not disturb
Dirty little words
3 dirty little words

Every time you leave
You say that someday you'll be back with me
Every time you leave you see, It's never really over

I don't wanna hang onto this rope no more
Trying to make it like it was before
Let me let you go
Tired of being tangled in this mess and I
I'm ready to wish you the best tonight
Let me let you go

Sometimes it feels like there's a wall around your heart
You're too scared to tell me you can't finish what you started
Cuz here we are again a million miles apart
Is that what you wanted
What you wanted

Every time you leave
You say that someday you'll be back with me
All I really need tonight is us to just be over

I don't wanna hang onto this rope no more
Trying to make it like it was before
Let me let you go
Tired of being tangled in this mess and I
I'm ready to wish you the best tonight
Let me let you go

Pulling down the curtain
Sure feel dumb rehearsing
I don't wanna hope for something that ain't working
Break the chains that bind us
Leave it all behind us
Don't you think it's time

I don't wanna hang onto this rope no more
Trying to make it like it was before
Let me let you go
Tired of being tangled in this mess and I
I'm ready to wish you the best tonight
Let me let you go

Let me let you go
Tired of being tangled in this mess and I
I'm ready to wish you the best tonight
Let me let you go

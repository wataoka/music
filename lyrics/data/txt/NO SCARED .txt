I wanna bring it back, We never carry on
I wanna bring it back, We never carry on
Seize it somehow seize it somehow
Only thing I lose

We hurry on, 'cuz we are coming to the end
We hurry on, 'cuz we are coming to the end
I know it's me I could be one from millions
I never trust anything to survive

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
Now scared to death with the burning blue flame we are

Can you reach out? Shout it out! you shout it out!!
Seize it somehow seize it somehow
Only thing I lose

We hurry on, 'cuz we are coming to the end
We hurry on, 'cuz we are coming to the end
I know it's me I could be one from millions
I never trust anything to survive

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
Now scared to death with the burning blue flame we are

Touch it touch it, don't you know it's just begun
Watch it watch it, make me feel like the man
Break it break it. We can't leave it undone
Kill the sound, you are maybe alive

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
Now moving closer to the blue flame we are

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
I've got to leave you nothing to take any more

That's all, I'll be all right
That's why you take me back
That's the price I must pay?
Now scared to death with the burning blue
flame we are

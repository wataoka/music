I wandered alone
in the rain
Ah,once upon a time

And it was so cold
till you came
and made it so fine

※And baby,baby,you
　You changed my life
　Oh babe
　Can you feel It too?
　Getting better
　every day

※※Every day I fall in love
　　In love again with you
　　Every day you fill me up
　　with dreams you make come true

　　Every day you bring the sun
　　and chase the night away
　　Every day,my precious one
　　I pray you're gonna stay
　　I need you every day

And right from the start
it was clear
this love is gonna last

I fall all apart
when you're near
I need you so bad

※Repeat

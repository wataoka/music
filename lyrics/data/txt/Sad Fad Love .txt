She's smiling.
Though she seems lonely for some reason.
I worry about that.
Is that because I'm in love?

That song was heard.
Then I remember her.
She has a beautiful lip.
And that looks like a doll.

But I know
But I know
I know that it's unrelated.

She's crying.
So I spoke to her gently.
She just says“It's OK.”
She doesn't open her heart.

I understand.
There is someone in her heart.
So I'm not supposed to fall in love for her.

I know
I know
I know that it's unrelated.

So I know
So I know
I know that it's unrelated.

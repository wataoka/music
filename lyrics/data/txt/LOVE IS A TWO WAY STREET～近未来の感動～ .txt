WE MADE A PROMISE
TO FORGIVE AND FORGET
AND HOLD ON TO THE JOY OF LIFE THAT WE'VE FOUND
AND LET'S REMEMBER
WE'RE ALL THAT WE'VE GOT NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE
THE WAY THAT WE FEEL

PROBLEMS MAY COME AND GO
IT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY
BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T,DOESN'T MATTER
CAUSE WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY

YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE
MORE THAN YOU TAKE 
ALL THE LOVIN' THAT YOU GET IS
THE LOVING THAT YOU MAKE
IT'S TRUTH
YOU TAKE THE BITTER,BITTER WITH THE SWEET
IT'S 50/50 LOVE IS A TWO WAY STREET

TREASURE WE'RE GONNA FIND
IF WE TAKE IT DAY BY DAY
WE'LL CROSS THE SANDS OF TIME
KEEP WALKING,WALKING ON LOVE'S HIGHWAY

LET US STAND AND COME TOGETHER IN LOVE UNCONDITIONAL
LET NOTHING COME BETWEEN US OR DIVIDED WE FALL

NOTHING CAN STOP US
AS WE TRAVEL THIS ROAD
HEADING FOR THE FUTURE
HOLDING ON TO LOVE
WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
NO DETOURS
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
WE'RE GOT THE WIND AT OUR BACK

PROBLEMS MAY COME AND GO
IT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY
BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T,DOESN'T MATTER
CAUSE WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY

LET US STAND AND COME TOGETHER IN LOVE UNCONDITIONAL
LET NOTHING COME BETWEEN US OR DIVIDED WE FALL

IT'S TRUE YOU TAKE THE BITTER,BITTER WITH THE SWEET
50/50 LOVE IS A TWO WAY STREET

LET US STAND AND COME TOGETHER IN LOVE UNCONDITIONAL
LET NOTHING COME BETWEEN US OR DIVIDED WE FALL

YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE
MORE THAN YOU TAKE 
ALL THE LOVIN' THAT YOU GET IS
THE LOVING THAT YOU MAKE
IT'S TRUTH
YOU TAKE THE BITTER,BITTER WITH THE SWEET
IT'S 50/50 LOVE IS A TWO WAY STREET

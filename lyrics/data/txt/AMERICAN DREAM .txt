Everybody's lookin'
For the good life
Like it's always been
On the silver screen
Glittering in the dim light
How easy it once seemed
Just to get a piece
Of the golden dream

Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me now where did it go?
Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me does anyone know?

Everybody's lookin'
For that one chance
Knockin' on the door
Of opportunity
Listenin' to the Top Forty
On the radio
I know rock'n'roll
Was the chance for me

Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me now where did it go?
Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me does anyone know?

Chasing after the dream
Pride goes before the fall
In the end will I find
It's a mirage after all?

Everybody's lookin'
For their freedom
Everybody needs
Something to believe
Without a dream to guide them
A vision to achieve
Where would all
The starving masses be?

Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me now where did it go?
Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me does anyone know?

Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me now where did it go?
Lookin' for the American dream
Tell me does anyone know?

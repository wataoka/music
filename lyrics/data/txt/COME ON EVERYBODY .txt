壊れる 壊されてゆく
幼い 時代の魔法が
君にはわかりかけてる 憶病な自分を
心を熱くふるわす 何かを感じながらも
一人でいる時さえも 叫ぶこともできない
腐り切った欲望は
投げ捨ててもかまわない
足元が震えても 立ち向かうことだけ
忘れずに 忘れずにいろ Get up! Get up!
Get up and go!
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion

Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion
きっと今夜 ここで会えるさ

繰り返す 繰り返される
ためらいと 閉じた毎日
醒めた風な瞳の奥に 情熱が見えるのに
積み重なる悲しみは
吐き出してもかまわない
君だけをみつめている 誰かを愛すことだけ
忘れずに 忘れずにいろ Get up! Get up!
Get up and go!

Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion

Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion
きっと今夜 捜し出せるさ

Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion

Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion
きっと今夜 ここで会えるさ

Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dancin' Don't stop the music
Come on everybody Shake it everybody
Don't stop dreamin' Don't stop the passion…

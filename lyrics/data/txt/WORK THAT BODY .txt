It's got me stomping, got me pumping, got me jumping,
it's so enhancing how I'm prancing it's got me dancing,
got me searching got me jerking got me working,
Don't have to hold no hands just
shake your pants, get down and dance

It's got me stomping, got me pumping, got me jumping,
it's so enhancing how I'm prancing it's got me dancing,

Got me steaming, now I'm screaming, got me dreaming
I'm so delighted, I can't fight it, I'm so excited
and when I hear it, I really feel it, I got the spirit,
It sounds so bold its got a hold on my soul.

All you have to do
To dig the party
Just come on down
and work that body
Just mix the motion
With the music
That's the only way to do it

Turning around and around
Influenced by the sound
Forget about the time
And just relax your mind
The music makes me start
It moves all through my heart
So don't you miss this chance
Come on get down and dance

It's got me stomping, got me pumping, got me jumping,
it's so enhancing how I'm prancing it's got me dancing,
got me searching got me jerking got me working,
Don't have to hold no hands just
shake your pants, get down and dance

All you have to do
To dig the party
Just come on down
and work that body
Just mix the motion
With the music
That's the only way to do it

Just mix the music with the motion
And you will have a dance explosion
I must be in the rhythm ocean
Cause I am soaked with this motion
Oh work that body, work, work that body.
work that body, work, work that body.
Everybody's shaking
Everybody's breaking
Everybody's movin'
Everybody's groovin'

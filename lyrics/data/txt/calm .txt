遥か遠くに 重ねた祈りがある
太古のクローバー 優しい風を知る

春を待つように さえずる夕告鳥
獣は眠り 世界の夢を見る

I was born here 言葉にできぬままに
I was born here 答えに この静けさに

芽ばう種が見上げた 初めての空
その美しさを守る意味を知る

嗚呼 忘れぬように
この空継ぐ意味を この美しさを守る強さを

I was born here 言葉にできぬままに
I was born here 答えに この静けさに

遠くで 遠くで 答えは溢れて
貴方は今もそこに

I was born here 言葉にできぬままに
I was born here 答えに この静けさに

I was born here
I was... I was born here I was...

Full moon sways
Gently in the night of one fine day

On my way
Looking for a moment with my dear

Full moon waves
Slowly on the surface of the lake

You were there
Smiling in my arms for all those years

What a fool
I don't know 'bout tomorrow
What it's like to be
Ah...

I was fool
Couldn't let myself to go
Even though I feel
The end

Old love affair
Floating like a bird resting her wings

You were there
Smiling in my arms for all those years

What a fool
I don't know 'bout tomorrow
What it's like to be
Ah...

I was fool
Couldn't let myself to go
Even though I feel
The end

Full moon sways
Gently in the night of one fine day

You were there
Smiling in my arms for all those years

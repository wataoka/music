I'm gonna make your heaven
Tell me your wish in your hell
罪深き深淵に見た月
私に触れて 硝子の中に
悲しみを映し出して Dolly Eyes

Hello... My dear†
Can you hear my voice?
心に闇を広げて
Let's make a wish!
真っ暗な瞳に 何が見えたの?

Can't hide the scars, they cut too deep now
And you know just what they mean
Don't want to live and don't want to die now
You are stuck here in between
Do you kill yourself, return yourself now
To the devil in your dream?
Your darkest wishes all come true now
Via pain that can't be seen

目を逸らさないで ここにいるわ
Baby I'm here
鏡の世界で逢える
You can see my face
I'M YOUR DEVIL
I live inside your mind

Yes, my princess
Your DEVIL is here

解いたら苦しくなる
記憶の結び目に
傷をつけ消してあげる

Be very careful what you wish now,
and be all that you can be
I am your devil woken up now,
and I'm here to set you free
Inside you hear two voices scream now,
that is you and that is me
Just think of me as part of you now,
I'm your inner “Heavenly”

零れたインクでここに誓えるのなら
Show me your dream
叶えてあげる その悪夢を
I'M YOUR DEVIL
I live inside your mind

Can't hide the scars, they cut too deep now
And you know just what they mean
Don't want to live and don't want to die now
You are stuck here in between
Do you kill yourself, return yourself now
To the devil in your dream?
Your darkest wishes all come true now
Via pain that can't be seen

Can you hear my voice?
Your DEVIL is here

I'm gonna make your heaven
Tell me your wish in your hell
後悔をミルク色に染めて
陶器のように滑らかな手で
そのハート私に差し出して

Be very careful what you wish now,
and be all that you can be
I am your devil woken up now,
and I'm here to set you free
Inside you hear two voices scream now,
that is you and that is me
Just think of me as part of you now,
I'm your inner “Heavenly”

You can call me heavenly6

目を逸らさないで
ここにいるわBaby I'm here
鏡を覗いて私を選んでMy Dear
深紅のインクで闇に誓えるのなら
Show me your dream
叶えてあげるその悪夢を
I'M YOUR DEVIL
I live inside your mind

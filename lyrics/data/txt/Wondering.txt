Wondering if I am lost now
But finding my way back home and
Wondering if love is with me
And guiding my destiny

Wondering if we are true friends
That distance cannot destroy and
Wondering if you are lonely
While waiting for my return

Come, be one with me
Let us follow the path of light
Mystery seeks to be understood
Some day we'll find truth

Wondering just who I might be
Who I was and will become and
Wondering if I can move on
Move into the world above

Come, be one with me
Let us follow the path of light
Mystery seeks to be understood
Some day we'll find truth

Wondering if I am lost now
But finding my way back home and
Wondering if love is with me
And guiding my destiny

Wondering just who I might be
Who I was and will become and
Wondering if I can move on
Move into the world above

Drivin' through my Tokyo town
Let me tell you want some fun?
Everything is alright, tonight tonight

You're my angel, Pulsar
And they say you looks so pretty, too
Wondrin' why we could do it, tonight

See my baby tryin' so hard
Gonna get my kicks to start
I don't wonna go back, tonight tonight

You're taking care of your style
Shall we never be apart
I don't know how much I care tonight

A garden needs flowers
Like a man needs a woman's love
I love you, Pulsar
Like an hour, an hour needs seconds too
Beautiful, beautiful you
Beautiful, beautiful you
Everybody turn to see
This beautiful my hot new car

Don't you ever ask me why
Though I never treat you right
'Cos I'm gonna be close to your heart your heart

All day long I need you
No matter what you gonna say
It's alright just to be with you

Drivin' through my Tokyo town
Let me tell you want some fun?
Everything is alright, tonight tonight

You're my angel, Pulsar
And they say you looks so pretty, too
Wondrin' why we could do it, tonight

A garden needs flowers
Like a man needs a woman's love
I love you, Pulsar
Like an hour, an hour needs seconds too
Beautiful, beautiful you
Beautiful, beautiful you
Everybody turn to see
This beautiful my hot new car

Everybody turn to see
This beautiful my hot new car

All or nothing, you live or die
Thank god you are alive
Lost everything Everything but life
Got nothing more to lose
Out of luck Out of hope Out of light
Let your tears fall down on me
I'm with you Hang Tough

Hang Tough! Hang Tough! I'm with you Hang Tough!
Realize the truth of life and change will arrive
Hang Tough! Hang Tough! I'm with you Hang Tough!

Who saved you from misery? Was it your God and faith?
Politicians, you know our pain? Can you walk the talk?
How many tears and blood must we shed to smile once again?
Fear follows you everywhere but you can overcome
There's nothing better than being alive, there's nothing else to lose
Hang Tough!Hang Tough!
You've gotta Hang Tough
Hang Tough

Hang Tough! Hang Tough! I'm with you Hang Tough!
Realize the truth of life and change will arrive
Hang Tough! Hang Tough! I'm with you Hang Tough!

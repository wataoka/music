wasn't there a wish
wasn't there a dream somewhere
wasn't there a word
one with better days waiting for us out there, somewhere

wasn't there something sacred
something to give us hope
are there still miracles?
or will the graces of god forever fall to the shame of man
can anybody help me change the things that i see?
if i could make a wish
if i could find a dream somewhere
one with different days waiting for us somewhere out there

if there was a light
something sacred
something to give hope
would we find miracles?
or would the faces of god forever frown upon the shame of man
can anybody help me change the things i see?

When you say...

Maybe there's no reason we're here
You're trying to find some meaning in it all
A little spider in your head don't want you to see
So he keeps you in his web
A little too close to an emotion that won't let you glow inside
So tell me baby what can I do about it?
I want you to see there's better way for you

When you say that the morning never seems to shine it's light
When you say that the stars are there to keep you warm at night
When you say that the there's no one there to ever hold you tight
I'll try find a place that's safe for you
And I won't ever leave you there alone

When you say...I wanted to believe...

Maybe there's no reason we're here
I'll find it if it helps you leave the web
There's sweetness in everything
Just hold on to me and whisper in my ear
Oh I'll take you far away from all of that hurt you feel
So tell me baby that you believe and want it(Say it back to me baby, say it back to me)
And you'll finally be where you're meant to be

When you say that the morning never seems to shine it's light
When you say that the stars are there to keep you warm at night
When you say that the there's no one there to ever hold you tight
(You're hiding up inside it, you're drying up so leave it)
I'll try find a place that's safe for you
And I won't ever leave you there alone
No, I won't ever leave you there alone

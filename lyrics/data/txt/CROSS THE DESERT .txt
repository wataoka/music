you don't begin to come out of the desert again
you lost yourselves shape and wandering darkness desert
you don't begin to come out of the desert again    no one will notice you
you lost yourselves ahape and wandering darkness desert
you don't begin to come out of the desert again    no one will notice you

there is neither despair nor hope there
only, as much as sand dances
only white sand dances
only repeat it

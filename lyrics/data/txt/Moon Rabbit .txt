Somebody is crying tonight.
Can you see the moon in the sky?
Somebody is crying tonight.
I'm a rabbit. Can you feel my heart?

今夜も屋根の上に 浮かび出すシルエット
沈んだ太陽は good sleepin' 今輝き出すの
はぐれた音のカケラを 見つけては
足りない私の体に 今ひとつになって

見上げた夜空に full moon 見えたら
耳を傾けてみて ほら 聴こえるでしょ?

※Don't look away. I'm rabbit feeling lonely.
Shining brightly on a full moon night.
Keep feeling it. I'm a rabbit who feels lonely.
I keep singing to you till the sunrise. yeah※

Don't look away. I'm rabbit feeling lonely.
Shining brightly on a full moon night.
Keep feeling it. I'm a rabbit who feels lonely.
I keep singing to you till the sunrise.
moon night.

Into the moonlight. 24時のミラーボール
照らされた鼓動 高鳴る lowbeat 響かせて
Just cage me now! あなたの声 遠くても catch するための
ふたつの大きな耳 ぴんと立てて
待ち焦がれる Give me your love.

月光の兎は 寂しくて強がって
ひとり瞼とじて 涙零れないように夢を見るの

Don't look away. I'm rabbit feeling lonely.
Shining brightly on a full moon night.
Keep feeling it. I'm a rabbit who feels lonely.
I keep singing to you till the sunrise. yeah

どんな夜でも いつか差し込む陽
遮られていく空は will be rainy with my tears from the moon.

Don't look away. I'm rabbit feeling lonely.
Shining brightly on a full moon night.

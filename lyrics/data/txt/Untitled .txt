We can share it all bring back it all
We cannot forget must not forget
We discussed serious matter along with the nonsense in our lives
We let each other know with special words and simple words

We can share it all bring back it all
We cannot forget must not forget
So many things that became natural
So many rules we both made
And I know the things that make you mad

Won't stop for anything or kill each other's dreams
And even if we live apart our hearts will stay together
Though our strides and the sights we are seeing may not be the same
Even so we will move forward and go side-by-side

I'll let it all come out and I will fight it out
I'll see the many successes I'll see the many failures
But I will not regret and I'll find my way back here again
I have a harbor to go home
That's why our ship will go everywhere

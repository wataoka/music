You were my fantasy 
Now you're reality 
You found a way into my life from my dreams 
You've given me everything 
I never thought love could bring 
You found a way into my heart from my dreams 

You were my fantasy 
Now you're reality 
You found a way into my life from my dreams 
You've given me everything 
I never thought love could bring 
You found a way into my heart from my dreams 

Before I met you I'd always get by 
I never doubted I was strong inside 
I was happy with my life (my life) 
'cause everything was goin' as I planned 
I always knew I had the upper hand 
And I could handle anything (anything) 

I never gave a thought to the possibility 
That there was something missing (missing) 
So hung up on makin' me my priority 
I only had to listen (listen) to my imagination 

You were my fantasy 
Now you're reality 
You found a way into my life from my dreams 
You've given me everything 
I never thought love could bring 
You found a way into my heart from my dreams

I wake up in the mornin' feelin' fine 
Now you're the first thing that is on my mind 
I can feel a change in me (in me) 
Emotions that I never knew I had 
Are pouring out of me 'cause I'm so glad 
Of what you mean to me, to me 

I never gave a thought to the possibility 
That there was something missing (missing) 
So hung up on makin' me my priority 
I only had to listen (listen) to my imagination

A breeze of love,Eolia
Eolia in the sky

You can feel…
You can feel it…
When you call out my name
I can see the wind just blows
And I'll send all my love to Your place

So you can feel,Eolia
A breeze of love,Eolia
It's from my heart,Eolia
Eolia in the sky

When you call out my name
I can see the wind just blows
And I'll send all my love to your place

So you can feel,Eolia
A breeze of love ,Eolia
It's from my heart,Eolia
Eolia in the sky

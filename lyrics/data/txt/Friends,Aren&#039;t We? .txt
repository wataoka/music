Didn't we use to hang out together?
On a midnight street going nowhere
Even when we're lost it was the two of us close together
We enjoyed all the foolish conversation
Though the morning took away the fascination
Let us make fuss over small things like we used to do my dearest

Don't you know that I'll be by your side
When you feel that there's no place to hide
I will take you by the hand
To the place that even your love can't find a way
Let's go on a rolled coaster

We are friends.
Friends, aren't we?
We are friends.
Friends, aren't we?
Eventually

This is not the end of the rainbow
So you don't have to feel any sorrow
I just want to skip today
So I can be with you tomorrow
When was the last time we had each other
We felt so safe as brother and sister
We cried and laughed until we fell into the arms or another

Don't you know that I'll come around
When you're alone and true friends can't be found
Why don't we meet around the corner
Whenever sooner the better I'll be with you
I miss you and our old school days

We are friends.
Friends, aren't we?
We are friends.
Friends, aren't we?
Eventually

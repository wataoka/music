(Oh Baby) The Story that I
(No Baby) 俺のせいじゃない
So, let me sing for You & Me
(So Baby) Now close your eyes
想いを届けたい
I love you (babe) so stay with me

The one too beautiful, you're always shinin' baby
眩しすぎるよ and no one can beat it

(Oh Baby) let me tell you why I try
君がいれば, make me feel alright
言葉にならないくらい
my life, all my life
(Oh Baby) let me show you why I try
君が笑えば, I feel alive
もう決して明日に迷わない
Sunshine, Sunshine,,, is you,,,

(Oh you know) you're shining all the time,
I don't wanna let you go,,,

(Oh Baby) Tell me one time,
(No Baby) 誰のせいじゃない
So, let me sing for You & Me
(So Baby) now hold me tight
想いを叶えたい
I love you (babe) so stay with me

Let me be the one who knows
how to be so special baby
熱く響く鼓動 and no one can beat it

(Oh Baby) let me tell you why I try
俺といれば, make you feel alright
言葉にならないくらい
your life, all your life

(Oh Baby) let me show you why I try
君が笑えば, I feel alive
もう決して明日に迷わない
Sunshine, Sunshine,,, is you,,,

(Oh Baby) The one too beautiful,
you're always shinin' baby
and no one can beat it 眩しすぎるよ
I know, you know baby
I know, you know It's eternal

(Oh you know) you're shining all the time,
I don't wanna let you go,,,

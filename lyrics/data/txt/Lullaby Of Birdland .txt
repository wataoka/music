Lullaby Of Birdland that's what I always hear
When you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love
That's the kind of magic music
We make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy ol' willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry on my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby Of Birdland, whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flying high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
We're in love

And there's a weepy ol' willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry on my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby Of Birdland, whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flying high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love

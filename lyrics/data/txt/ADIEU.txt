BEEN A FOOL, BEEN A CLOWN
LOST MY WAY FROM UP AND DOWN
AND I KNOW, YES I KNOW
AND I SEE IN YOUR EYES 
THAT YOu REALLY WEREN'T SURPRISED AT ME AT ALL
NOT AT ALL
AND I KNOW BY YOUR SMILE IT'S YOU.

DON'T CARE FOR ME, DON'T CRY
LET'S SAY GOODBYE ADIEU.
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE, I KNOW THAT IN TIME
IT WILL JUST FADE AWAY, IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE.

I STAND ALONE AND WATCH YOU FADE AWAY LIKE CLOUDS
HIGH UP AND IN THE SKY
I'M STRONG AND SO COLD
AS I STAND ALONE
GOODBYE, SO LONG, ADIEU.

※OH HOW I LOVE YOU SO, LOST IN THOSE MEM　ORIES
　AND NOW YOU'VE GONE
　I FEEL THE PAIN, FEELING LIKE A FOOL, ADIEU

※※MY LOVE FOR YOU BURNS DEEP
　　INSIDE ME, SO STRONG
　　EMBERS OF TIMES WE HAD
　　AND NOW HERE I STAND LOST IN A MEMORY
　　I SEE YOUR FACE AND SMILE

※Repeat

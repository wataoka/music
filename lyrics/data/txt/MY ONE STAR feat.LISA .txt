Beautiful stars! eternal shining stars!
思いを照らす、twinkling endlessly
Crystals of the night, you are my guiding light
Forever holding me, いつの夜も…

These stars that glow above
美しく they're all glowing for me
Widely embracing earth
every light,it means a treasure to me

In my dreams, I spread my wings, I'm flying
freely dancing in the night, like an angel
I don't ever want to lose this feeling
still be there, when I awake, shining!

Beautiful stars! eternal shining stars!
思いを照らす、twinkling endlessly
Crystals of the night, you are my guiding light
Forever holding me, いつの夜も…

Look up to the skies, I smile, believing
spirit 届いていること
these songs of love, I'll sing so hear me!
till the day you find me in your magic…

The way you float in peace
and the way you always 輝く
let's me know, I don't need
to be worried 'bout ever lonely

夜空に blow a kiss of promise
as I dive into the deep blue night
I don't ever want to lose this feeling
can I keep this fantasy, for me?

Beautiful stars! eternal shining stars!
夢ごと包む so gentle and sweet
Diamonds of the night, don't ever say good-bye
your blessings make my life, 永遠に光る…

Everytime I reach, I breathe, believing
いつか星になる, like you
these songs of life, I'll keep on writing
till the day you take me into your magic…

Beautiful stars! eternal shining stars!
思いを照らす、twinkling endlessly
Crystals of the night, you are my guiding light
Forever holding me, いつの夜も…

Look up to the skies, I smile, believing
spirit 届いていること
these songs of love, I'll sing so hear me!
till the day you find me in your magic…

now I believe something inside my heart
strange green eyes
but it's not a ghost or anything suspicious

when the tears fall down and hit the ground
when the dream dries out in front of you
is when it comes

wherever you go whatever you do
you're going to hear the dark footsteps coming after you tonight

I don't believe something behind that door
from the time I was born oh has hidden deep inside

and the strange green eyes eats away at my soul
slowly it makes me realize
I didn't mean to make you cry

coz I still believe believe in you
no matter what they say
the clouds will go away someday for you

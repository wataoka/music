"どんなふうに?"昨日に問いかける
憧れを諦められない
受話器越し沈む君の声
あともう少し向き合えたのなら

揺れる列車の窓に広がる
大きな大きな雲追いかけて

If I knew If I knew If I knew just what to do… yeah
All I know All I know is that I wouldn't be headin' home
If for only this one decision was not mine to chose
I wouldn't be headin' on home
I wouldn't be headin' on home

"こんなふうに?"明日に問いかける
不器用で抑える事できない
間違いを認めているようで
あともう少し早く気づいていたら

細く長くなんてつまらない
大きな大きな翼ひろげて

If I knew If I knew If I knew just what to do… yeah
All I know All I know is that I wouldn't be headin' home
If for only this one decision was not mine to chose
I wouldn't be headin' on home
I wouldn't be headin' on home

If I knew If I knew If I knew just what to do… yeah
All I know All I know is that I wouldn't be headin' home
If for only this one decision was not mine to chose
I wouldn't be headin' on home
I wouldn't be headin' on home

"どんなふうに?"明日に問いかける

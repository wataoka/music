Listen, my baby Do you remember?
It's been a long since last we saw the stars
I hope we could see, all night together, stars in the sky

※Hold me slowly, my sweet babe
　Touch me gently, 'cause a special night
　Kiss me softly, as many as stars
　I love you really Baby can I?

Tell me, my baby You know the number
Yeah, of the wrong thing that you did for me 
I want you to forget it all right we go there to find our stars

※repeat

&quot;Do you wanna move our bed tonight? Just tonight&quot;
&quot;Yeah, on the roof&quot;
&quot;It's gonna be a special night&quot;

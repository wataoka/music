Where is the Mountain Alps beauty?
(Lost at me so fine)
Wind of 70's, not so scary
What I'm feeling

I'm sleeping with fruits of the land
(Look at me so fine)
So nice to leave me anything
I can be happy

Love's helping anyway, it's nothing red cheeks for me

See what I'm doing, love's so scary
If you really love Pater lots
You're gonna choose me,
Heidi, such cutie girl
Hey daddy, mommy heavenly
Your heart pulls it always I can't
Loose you from my mind
Darlin hipper boys are all I need

So nice to leave me anything
It makes me happy

Rivalis Candy, it's nothing red cheeks for me

See what I'm doing, love's so scary

Hey daddy, mommy heavenly
Your heart pulls it always I can't
Loose you from my mind
Darlin hipper boys are all I need

I know that every one is sweet
When they smile and stand by me
My sweet simple Curara
I know that every one is sweet
Wendy running flowers says be yourself!

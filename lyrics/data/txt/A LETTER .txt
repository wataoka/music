All my friends have gone away
I need myself to sing this song
But you always passed away
But It seems to be o.k.
All my wish and powers
They would take me to the gate
Should I really find my problem ?
Do I really want to know about ?
I'm writing a letter for me
Is there anything I would say ?

I don't have to throw my life away
Everything goes wrong to turn into the way of life
This could take so long to find the way
All those people cry in vain
Now I see the light in pain
I can find the way of love

You don't have to throw your life away
Everything goes wrong to turn into the way of life
This could take so long to find the way
All those people cry in vain
Now you see the light in pain

Say good bye into the perfect sky
But it's your love can be the real life line

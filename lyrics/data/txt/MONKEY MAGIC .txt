Born from on egg on a mountain top
The punkiest monkey that ever popped
He knew every magic trick under the sun
To tease the Gods
And everyone and have some fun

Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic

What a cocky saucy monkey this one is
All the Gods were angered
And they punished him
Until he was saved by a kindly priest
And that was the start
Of their pilgrimage west

Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic

With a little bit of monkey magic
There'll be fireworks tonight
With a little bit of monkey magic
Everything will be all right

Born from on egg on a mountain top
The punkiest monkey that ever popped
He knew every magic trick under the sun
To tease the Gods
And everyone and have some fun

Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic
Monkey magic, Monkey magic

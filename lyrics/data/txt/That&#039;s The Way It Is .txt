I can read your mind and I know your story
I see what you're going through
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you

Don't surrender ‘cause you can win
In this thing called love

When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you are ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know,what to say, no
But it's plain to see,if you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah

So don't surrender ‘cause you can win
In this thing called love

When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you are ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

When life is empty with no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call
Baby don't worry, forget your sorrow
‘Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all

When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you are ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you are ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

That's the way it is
That's the way it is, babe
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

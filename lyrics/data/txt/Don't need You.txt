I believe in roses, but（only from the heart）
And if it's not sincere then,
I don't want no part
Even if you trust in me（You will mess around）
What I don't know can't hurt me
That's not the way I see

Just close my eyes
（I）can see you and her flirtations
Don't even call my name
I had enough

I don't need your love
I don't need your trust
I don't need your kiss
I don't need at all
Don't want miss your heart
Don't want miss your touch
Don't want miss you
If you're not around

I don't need your help
I don't need your smile
I don't need your words
I don't need at all
Don't want miss your smell
Don't want miss your voice
Don't want miss you
Now leave me alone

I believe in angels are（watching what we do now）
And all the wrong you are doing
Night come back on you
While you have taken me for（granted boy I'm through）
So baby, you can kiss this girl
Good bye forever
No more pain,
No more tears, I am moving on
I can see dearly now
Found my own way

I don't need your love
I don't need your trust
I don't need your kiss
I don't need at all
Don't want miss your heart
Don't want miss your touch
Don't want miss you
If you're not around

I don't need your help
I don't need your smile
I don't need your words
I don't need at all
Don't want miss your smell
Don't want miss your voice
Don't want miss you
Now leave me alone

「I believe in angels are watching what we do now
And all the wrong you are doing
Night come back on you
So baby, You can kiss this girl
Good bye forever」

Just close my eyes
（I）can see you and her flirtations
Don't even call my name
I had enough

I don't need your love
I don't need your trust
I don't need your kiss
I don't need at all
Don't want miss your heart
Don't want miss your touch
Don't want miss you
If you're not around

I don't need your help
I don't need your smile
I don't need your words
I don't need at all
Don't want miss your smell
Don't want miss your voice
Don't want miss you
Now leave me alone

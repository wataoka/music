MY HOPE IS FADED
I GAVE IT ALL I HAD, I'M SO FRUSTRATED
WAS I NEEDY? OR MAYBE A LITTLE GREEDY?
IT'S SO COMPLICATED
SHOULD LOVE BE THIS OR THAT, I KEEP DEBATING
WAS I LAZY? OR MAYBE A LITTLE CRAZY?

AS A FLOWER STARTS TO GROW
WE DON'T NOTICE WE DON'T KNOW
SO WE BRUSH IT ASIDE AND LET IT DIE
WHEN IT COMES UP FROM THE GROUND
THERE IS NO SYMPHONY, THERE IS NO SOUND
SO WE LET THE BEAUTY PASS US BY

FLOWERS, FLOWERS, FLOWERS
WILL THEY BE MINE? I HOPE I GET SOME SOON
FLOWERS, FLOWERS, FLOWERS
WILL THEY EVER BLOOM?

MY MIND IS RACING
THERE'S A LOT THAT I CAN SAY, BUT I'M HESITATING
WISH I KNEW HOW TO REALLY LOVE YOU
LIKE I'M PASING
NEVER SEEM TO FIND MY WAY ON THE PATH YOU'RE TAKING
WISH I KNEW HOW TO BE WITHOUT YOU

AS SEED BEGINS TO GROW
WE DON'T NOTICE WE DON'T KNOW
SO WE BRUSH IT ASIDE AND LET IT DIE
WHEN YOU'VE GOT FLOWERS ALL AROUND
THERE IS NO SYMPHONY, THERE IS NO SOUND
SO WE LET THE BEAUTY PASS US BY

FLOWERS, FLOWERS, FLOWERS
WILL THEY BE MINE? I HOPE TO GET SOME SOON
FLOWERS, FLOWERS, FLOWERS
WILL THEY EVER BLOOM?

FLOWERS, FLOWERS, FLOWERS
WILL THEY BE MINE? I HOPE I GET SOME SOON
FLOWERS, FLOWERS, FLOWERS
WILL THEY EVER BLOOM?

FLOWERS, FLOWERS
I GAVE YOU ALL I HAD SO WON'T YOU BLOOM???

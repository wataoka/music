A few stolen moments is all that we share.
You've got your family, and they need you there.
Though I try to resist, being last on your list,
But no other man's gonna do,
So I'm saving all my love for you.

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own.
But each time l try, I just break down and cry,
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue.
So I'm savin' all my love for you.

You used to tell me we'd run away together.
Love gives you the right to be free.
You said be patient, just wait a little longer.
But that's just an old fantasy.

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more.
Gonna get that old feeling, when you walk through that door.
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving an my love for you.

No other women is gonna love you more.
Cause tonight is the night.
That I'm feeling alright.
We'll be making love the whole night through.
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm savin' all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving an my love for you, for you, for you

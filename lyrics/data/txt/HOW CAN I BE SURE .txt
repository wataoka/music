How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure
Where I stand with you
Whenever I whenever I-I'm away
From you-I want to die
Cause you know I wanna stay with you
How do I know maybe you're trying to use me
Flyins too high can confuse me
Touch me but don't take me down

Whenever I whenever I-I'm away
From you-my alibi
Is tellin' people I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head
upside down it's a pity
I can't seem to find someone who's
as pretty and lovely as you

How can I be sure
I really really really want to know
I really really really want to know
How's the weather
Whether or not we're together
Together we'll see it much better
I love you I love you forever
You know where I can be found

How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing
How can I be sure
I'll be sure with you

Living in this boring world
Everyday just passing by
Nobody's fault
I'm making my choice all the time

Standing still feet on the run
Stare at the sky never see the sun
In and out of mind still searching for a sign

Something is wrong We're losing our senses
Really need to know what I am

Shouting out my name Tryin' to find my way
I just need a new sensation
Can't just sit and die. Baby I'll come alive
Pull the thread from all these stiches
We can't make it without friction

Uncivilized this modern world
Feed the poor with empty words
They're just killing time and thinking no one would mind

What's going on Everything in a haze
I'm not hiding anymore

Shouting out my name Walking down broadway
I just got a new direction
Maybe I'd better fight I gotta live my life
Won't be scared to lose everything

Shouting out my name Try to make you see my face
Now I'm gonna do it my way
Baby I gotta fight, fight for my life
Ain't nothin' that I won't be missin'
Nothing happens without friction

Psyche溶け出しFrozen 震え咲き出すFlower
Sensitivity千切れて 繰り返すSplit

Cold wind disappoints me
My nervous bad habit
The vicious circle doesn't stop

Break me
Please kill me out at your beautiful hand
Before I break your mind
Please kill me out at your beautiful hand
Before I dirty your mind

Always 忘れたくて
Always 逃げ場は無くて
In my head 絡み合わぬ黒と白が蠢く

秒刻みの針が耳の奥でDelay
Without cease流れ出す
混ざり合わぬVision

Cold wind disappoints me
My nervous bad habit
The vicious circle doesn't stop

Break me
Please kill me out at your beautiful hand
Before I break your mind
Please kill me out at your beautiful hand
Before I dirty your mind

Please delete my existence
I pray for your happiness
Before I kill your mind

Please kill me out at your beautiful hand

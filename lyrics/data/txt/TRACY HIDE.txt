Who is the girl by the railway station lost-and-found?
Her warm coat, eiderdown.
Her eyes are cloaked in auburn combed brown.

Tracy hide go seek within my mind.
Outside, the world seems so unkind. She hides.

Not far away from the schoolyard, carved an elegy.
'Til then, you're here with me.
The endless cry of an aching MELODY.

Tracy hide go seek within my mind.
Outside, the world seems so unkind. She hides.
I feel her holding back the tears of time,
Haunting me like a nursery rhyme

Who is the girl with the paintbox-
Canvas the sad clouded skies-

Opens her eyes to find me here-
To blind the fears and the lies.
Alone, she's my one and only truth.

Tracy hide go seek within my mind.
Outside, the world seems so unkind. She hides.

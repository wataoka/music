so I'm back again
in the town by the river
where you and I first met before

if I could see you now
in that same situation
I could give better vibrations to you

seasons change with the scenery
where you stand, what do you see
twisted shadows in the burning sun

you seem confused and lost
in the cheerful sessions
while they trade the stories and tunes

you slowly spoke your mind
about what's going on in your life
on our way to the cliff

※seasons change with the scenery
where you stand, what can you see
twisted shadows in the burning sun※

branching off ahead there lies a road
and a world that we haven't seen

if I could see you now and talk again
on that road going down to the sea

(※くり返し)

I've come back again
to the town by the river
where you and I first met before

if I could see you now and talk again
on that road going up to the sky

seasons change with the scenery
where you stand, what can you see
twisted shadows in the burning sun
where you stand, what can you see

Lying broken on the floor
Waitiig for her man to come back to her
She hums a melancholy tune
Just to pass the miserable time away away…

Though the candle has long before
Fickered off it's last ray of light to her
She see's a vision of his face
It is haunting her. Still unable to let him go
Shut the door, there's no need to look back

Close your eyes and sleep tonight
Let dreams escort you into the light
You'll find the love that you're looking for
You can do so much more…
But you still choose to care… For him

Reading back her diaries
She relives a distant memory
Those times are nothing but a haze
But she can not seem to face
What's then is now gone…
Shut the door, there's no need to look back

Close your eyes and sleep tonight
Let dreams escort you into the light
You'll find the love that you're looking for
You can do so much more… If you just
Say goodbye to yesterday
It's never too late to find a way
So take a look and you'll clearly see
You can do anything…
But you still choose to care…

There is always a sliver lining to a cloud
You gotta realize it now
Can't you feel
Endless love
It's shimmering all around you

Close your eyes and sleep tonight
Let dreams escort you into the light
You'll find the love that you're looking for
You can do so much more… if you just
Say goodbye to yesterday
It's never too late to find a way
So take a look and you'll clearly see
You can do anything…
But you still choose to care… For him

We are the youth we are the knights
We'll fight until we crash and burn in a thousand pieces

Put us all in line with a smile upon our faces
“Wear a shirt and tie and your future will be certified”
Wake up! The boy inside you cries
Wake up! The girl inside just cries out to you
“Open your eyes!!”

We are the youth we are the knights
We'll fight until we crash and burn in a thousand pieces
We are the youth we are the light
We'll shine until we crash and burn in flames

Label us with types put a sign around our necks
Sell our souls and pride now we're dying are you satisfied?
Wake up! The boy inside you cries
Wake up! The girl inside just cries out to you
“Open your eyes!!”

Now it's time for us to wake up
The voices inside our hearts will make us stronger now
Together we'll find a way we'll find a way

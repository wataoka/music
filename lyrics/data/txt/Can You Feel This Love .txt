Start this week
In a big way

With a good day
Make today
A big day

遠くで clock's ringing
聞こえる day's breaking
はじまる sunny day
My heart is racing for you, baby

久しぶりな tension
まぶしい your reflection
抑えきれずに
So tell me how you feel

I know you like me somehow
I know you don't wanna show
If you just let yourself go
And just think about me, babe
Someday you can feel it
I'll promise, baby
Na na na na na na na
It's gonna be soon, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Can you feel this love
Can you feel this love
Can you feel my heart that keeps burning
'Cause it's longing for your love

Can you feel this love
Can you feel this love
Can you feel my love
All you want is something good to you now

Can you feel this love
Can you feel this love
Can you feel my heart
Let me show you how to love me, baby now

Can you feel this love
Can you feel this love
Open up your mind
Listen to your heart and love me everyday

感じる time's running
このまま keep this feeling
逢えない時間も そう
Love is growing for you, baby

お互いの directions
失くさない discretion
届けたい気持ち
I belong to you

I know people come and go
でも we could meet somehow
You're the one I am looking for
You're the man of my dreams, babe
Someday you can dream it
I'll promise baby
Na na na na na na na
Love's gonna break through, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Waiting for you everyday
Thinking 'bout you every night
Imagine that you're mine
Don't you wanna be with me
Hiding from me everyday
Your smile's intoxicating
Thinking of you every time and I feel my love is crazy
Tell me, say that you love me
Say that you want me
Say that you need me, baby

Think of me
Care for me
Feel me

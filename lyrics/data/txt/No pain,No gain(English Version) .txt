Don't got the time for all this talking, I feel like yelling
No need to get caught up in failure as long as I'm winning
So I won't sit and take excuses, already heard it
I speak my mind and when I want it, I'll be first to get it

Girls
Just keep them guessing, go on and flaunt it
show them what u got
And when they want it, don't let them get in
Better come correctly
didn't mama tell u nothing's free

Go and get em, Fighter, scream it louder till they feel it
Cause we got that fire, don't you ever question who u are
Let's take it higher, are u ready to push the limit
Only got one chance around to live it up
There ain't no gain without the pain, so hit em hard

Don't wanna stop, don't wanna slow down, I feel like running
And if its flavor that you're craving, I got a lot of it
In case you haven't heard about it, I'll bring it to u
But if u get too close somebody might get hurt tonight

Boys
We see you watching, tell me can you handle it
Is that all you got?
You better come hard, cause we ain't easy
We'll take your best shot!
Need more than sweet talk to please me

Go and get em, Fighter, scream it louder till they feel it
Cause we got that fire, don't you ever question who u are
Let's take it higher, are u ready to push the limit
Only got one chance around to live it up
There ain't no gain without the pain, so hit em hard

Don't matter who U are
Don't matter what U do
It's all about standing up to do what's best for u
No matter what they say don't let them bring you down
Hold your head up high
Let them know who's in control

Go and get em, Fighter, scream it louder till they feel it
Cause we got that fire, don't you ever question who u are
Let's take it higher, are u ready to push the limit
Only got one chance around to live it up
There ain't no gain without the pain, so hit em hard

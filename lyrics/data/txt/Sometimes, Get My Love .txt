We're going to walking-down from 45 up to 42
You're waitin' lucky star in the house of the fool with silent truth
There was no chance, yesterday
There was no chance till yesterday
New fine day New fine way New fine man is living in next door

Hey boy, come around like a walking dog like a walking god
Sister moon, brother sun, please don't cover the midnight chance
Sometimes, get my love Sometimes, give your love
562-107-2424 call on me

Touch my nob Just my jonthon
Give one rocks Push it, girl

Hey girl, come around like a walking pig like a walking god
Sister moon, brother sun, please don't cover the midnight chance
Sometimes, get my love Sometimes, give your love
562-107-2424 call on me

Glamorous kiss Make love, man
Give one rocks Push it, girl

Drive me mad Drive me Mad
Drive me to mad of the world

Drive me mad Drive me Mad
Drive me to mad of the world

Hey baby, glamorous kiss Touch my nob
Give one rocks Move it Push it, girl

Drive me mad Drive me Mad
Drive me to mad of the world

Drive me mad Drive me Mad
Drive me to mad of the world

Sometimes get my love……

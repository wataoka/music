In my little car on this little island I drive
The rough road takes me to an unknown destination
I sing for myself from the bottom of my heart

How many ideas do I have in my heads now?
I wanna keep changing myself
I don't need a limit
A lot of detours on their way every time
when we lose something important
We look back at our past

The road is very straight, to be alive is lucky
Now I realized how much life is precious
Since I'm on that journey

No tall dreams are made to come true right away
But I won't be sad about my fate
I will never lose myself and my past

How many ideas do I have in my heads now?
I wanna keep changing myself
I don't need a limit
A lot of detours on their way every time
when we lose something important
We look back at our past

The road is very straight, to be alive is lucky
Now I realized how much life is precious
Since I'm on that journey

How many ideas do I have in my heads now?
I wanna keep changing myself
I don't need a limit
A lot of detours on their way every time
when we lose something important
We look back at our past

The road is very straight, to be alive is lucky
Now I realized how much life is precious
Since I'm on that journey

Surviving is my fate
I've gotta lot of things
I lost but our bonds of friendship just got better

The road is very straight, to be alive is lucky
Now I realized how much life is precious
Since I'm on that journey

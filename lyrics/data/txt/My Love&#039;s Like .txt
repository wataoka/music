The box of matches
This trousers' patches
A shelf of hardbacks
A pile of tin tacks

Sat in my room with nothing to do
Objects remind me of me and you

Because my love's like a shoehorn
Sliding in your soul
A bone-handled shoehorn
In the shoe of your heart
Turning me gold? wooohooohooo

A broken dartboard
This replica sword
The leather wath-strap
A rusty bath-tap

Gathering dust and piling up high
Objects surround us until we die

Because my love's like a shoehorn
Slipped under your heel
An old hotel shoehorn
With the curve of a life
Making us cold? wooohooohooo

Loaf of bread like the curve of your
earlobe
Your crust so pale
Standing here with my hand on your
wardrobe
Sweet clothing rail?
oooooooOOoOooOooOOooOO

My love's like a shoehorn
Sliding forever
It's too late to change
What these objects arrange
And your love's like a teaspoon
Stirring forever
The coffee of me
When all I want is some tea
With you?
oooOooOOOOOOooOoOOooOooO
oOoOoOoOOOoOOOOOooooOooOOO

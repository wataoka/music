Over the brown bridge
Uh-oh, do you see
a tall town for the dreamers?
Over, it was over
Uh-oh, before it starts
What's the point to cross over?
I was hoping that you realize
it's just a town for the tumblers
I was hoping that you wake up
and wake me up

Over the brown bridge
Uh-oh, I can see
a small town for the gamblers
Over, it was over
Uh-oh, because they were
too blind to ignore things
I was hoping that you realize
It's just a town for the hypocrites
I was hoping that you wake up
and wake me up

After all, they are still dreaming
After all, the problem's left
behind Statue
After all, they are still dreaming
After all...

Over the brown bridge
There's something going on
Over the brown bridge
There's ups, the middle and downs
I was hoping that you realize
It's just a town for the wanderers
I was hoping that you wake up
and wake me up

After all, they are still dreaming
After all, the problem's left
behind Statue
After all, they are still dreaming
After all...

People are still hanging in there
Over the brown bridge
I see myself again

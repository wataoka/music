I know,I know I've let you down 
I've been a fool to myself 
I thought that I could 
live for no one else 
But now through all the hurt and pain 
It's time for me to respect 
the ones you love 
mean more than anything 

So with sadness in my heart 
(I) feel the best thing I could do 
is end it all 
and leave forever 
what's done is done it feels so bad 
what once was happy now is sad 
I'll never love again 
my world is ending 

I wish that I could turn back time 
cos now the guilt is all mine 
can't live without 
the trust from those you love 
I know we can't forget the past 
you can't forget love&amp;pride 
because of that,it's kill in me inside 

It all returns to nothing,it all comes 
tumbling down,tumbling down, 
tumbling down 
It all returns to nothing,I just keep 
letting me down,letting me down, 
letting me down 
In my heart of hearts 
I know that I called never love again 
I've lost everything 
everything 
everything that matters to me,matters 
in this world 

I wish that I could turn back time 
cos now the guilt is all mine 
can't live without 
the trust from those you love 
I know we can't forget the past 
you can't forget love&amp;pride 
because of that,it's kill in me inside 

It all returns to nothing 
It just keeps tumbling down 
I just keep letting me down 
Letting me down letting me down 
It all returns to nothing 
It just keeps tumbling down 
Tumbling down tumbling down 
It all returns to nothing 
I just keep letting me down 
Letting me down letting me down 
Tumbling down tumbling down 
It all returns to nothing

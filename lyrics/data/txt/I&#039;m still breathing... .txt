Do you know the answer…my king?
What do you think about my “real”?
Calling.. calling..the Reaper.

Search for the light..?
That's kill oneself only.
Do you know the answer…god?

Don't give in to the pain.
I can't breathe no more
I can't..もうやめて

AH.. change my “life”. far away.
走り抜ける
OH.. change my “real”. Can I believe?
理由を探して
生きていた
生かされた
荒野の中
I'm still breathing…

And you know the answer…my king
What do you mean about my “game”?
Please..please.. forgive me

How reaching the light.
That's kill oneself only.
Do you know the answer…god?

Don't give in to the pain.
I can't breathe no more
I can't..赦して

AH.. change my “life”. far a way.
闇に堕ちて
OH.. change my “real”. Can I believe?
疑問だらけでも
息をする
君も僕も
荒野の中
I'm still breathing…

AH.. change my “life”. far a way.
胸が痛い
OH.. change my “real”. I can believe..
理由なんてないんだ
生きて行く
生かされた
輪廻の業(さが)
I'm still breathing…

No nothing helps
We won't stop right now
We did it on our own
Nobody else
It's because of you I'm standing here with you

Oh Yeah OK I've got bad days
so caught up in my mind and I'm
Not really sure who I am
and nothing seems to go my way at all

Then I hit the stage and remember
why I'm here
I'll be the voice
to those who don't have one
and never forget
the road back

No nothing helps
We won't stop right now
We did it on our own
Nobody else
It's because of you we finally came this far
And on and on another song
to write the wrongs that I
Tell me who else?
It thanks to all of you
that I could find my own way

Any longer and I'll know
each and every day every show
gotta give my best with innocence
It could be all taken away in a minute

There are things I always remember forever
Oh no
How can I walk this rocky road?
and never regret
I'll never know

No nothing helps
We won't stop right now
We did it on our own
Nobody else
It's because of you we finally came this far
And on and on another song
to write the wrongs that I
Tell me who else?
It thanks to all of you
that I could find my own way in this maze

I'm by myself
stuck inside my throat
The words they won't come out
Oh what the hell
Why don't I just leave, give up and let it all go away

But then I see your face and remember
why I'm here

No nothing helps
We won't stop right now
We did it on our own
Nobody else
It's because of you we finally came this far
Tell me who else?
It thanks to all of you
that I could find my way
Somebody else
Will someday come and then take my place
And so the story goes

All what I can do for you
All what you will want me to
All what you can see me through
Will someday come
The story goes

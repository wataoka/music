thick shady eerie woods
looking down on me
you're making me suffer
veiling most of my face
because I threw mud in heavenward

you and me
distant-wall relation
maybe the problem is me
this place hid the sun
set a fragile vision
in my held arms

understanding
how affection, it changed
will I able to see
before it slips
behind this dark lost green
all the...
please

the puppet woke me up early night
I was in the profound woods
where am I where am I
body covered with mud
all cells shattered to pieces
because i threw mud in downward

your on morality
never existed
he was leaver with ethic
infiction that you left me
such an ironic phase you laugter

understanding
how affection, it changed
will I able to see
fill up with nothing
behind this dark lost green
all the...
please

まだ降り注がないだろう
まだ降り注がないだろう
in my place nowhere

you and me
distant-wall relation
maybe the problem is me

stranded
how affection, it changed
will I able to see
before it slips
behind this dark lost green

stranded
how affection, it changes
will I able to see
fill up with nothing
behind this dark lost green
when will I know real affection

you're killing me

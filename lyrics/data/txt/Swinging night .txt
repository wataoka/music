Why are you staring at me so bad?
I'm sorry if you want jiggy-jiggy so bad
Oh, starry night
How sweet

Don't stop leering at me so bad
I'm nearly getting wet as well
Oh strange night
How sweet
Can you turn me on?

See you in your dream...
I'll be yours

You are swinging from the end of a rope
I'm looking at the swinging singing your heart
Oh, starry night
How sweet
Dreaming is free, you know

Out of the blue, you broke the ice
I don't care if you told a lie or not

Let's have fun
I'm not into feeling sad or singing in misery

It's a swinging night

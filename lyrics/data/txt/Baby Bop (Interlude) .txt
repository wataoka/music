Baby bop, do what, do what, bring it on, bring it up
I'm about to bring it up, bring it on, bring it now
Baby bop, do what, do what, turn it on, turn it up
I don't know what the meaning but bring it on, bring it now

Cause when you play it 
When you blow it
When you swing it
There's nothin' better, baby
Call me so you can tell me
When you play it
There's nothin' better, baby

Baby bop, do what, do what, bring it on, bring it now
I'm about to bring it up, bring it on, bring it now
Baby bop, do what, do what, turn it on, turn it up
I don't know what the meaning but bring it on, bring it now

Put on my make up
Put your drink up
When you play it
There's nothin' better, baby

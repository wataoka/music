I was looking at your face and it said you can
take another chance across my land
I was looking at another direction,
you're such a perfectionist for who you are

Oh gotta, stop! look at the feathers
stop! dadada... stop! look at the feathers in the sky
it's got lots of tension in me,
lots of people dancing,
lots of people dreaming all at once

Oh look at the sky, forgot to take the warning again
Oh get up and wash your face, 尖ったもので yeah

I was looking at your face and it said you can
take another chance across my land
I was looking at another direction,
you're such a narcissist for who you are

Oh gotta, stop! look at the feathers
stop! dadada... stop! look at the feathers in the sky
it's got lots of tension in me,
lots of people dancing,
lots of people dreaming all at once

Oh look at the sky, forgot to take the warning again
Oh get up and wash your face, 尖ったもので yeah

Like a bird in the sky, I get high
In the night, time is right, city light
I get lost in my head when I think of you
In the night, time is right, come on by

talking to me but I can't recall your name...

Like a bird in the sky, I get high
In the night, time is right, city light
I get lost in my head when I think of you
In the night, time is right, come on by
夜の空に鳥が鳴く 壊れそうな心で
I get lost in my head when I think of you,
In the night, time is right, come on by
In the night, time is right, come on by
In the night, time is right, come on by
In the night, time is right, come on by
In the night, time is right, come on by
In the night, time is right, come on by
In the night, time is right, come on by

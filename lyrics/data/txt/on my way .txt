I formed the band Back in 98
With my bro TAKE
We gave it a name and it was FLOW
And then Y2K 3 guys joined the band
Made our major debut on TV screen

We'd go on a tour And radio shows
We were on the run
All the ups and the downs
Everything would become our strength

I'm on my way and I won't turn around
Goodbye to yesterday Say“Hello tomorrow”
With you All the members
There's no turning back anymore
I'll keep dreaming til I get there How far are you?
But I know I'm on my way

Thank you my friends To people we've met
Who stayed and who left
I feel like the reason why we're here
After all these years Is because of you
Who made all of our greatest dreams come true

The place we belong The place we will be
Will always be here On the stage we perform
On the stage we will play and sing
I'm on my way and I won't turn around
Goodbye to yesterday Say“Hello tomorrow”
With you All the members
There's no turning back anymore
I'll keep dreaming til I get there how far are you
But I know I'm on my way But I know I'm on my way

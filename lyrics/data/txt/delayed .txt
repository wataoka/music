I'll be late

I know
I feel
Got a feeling I'll be late

It's hard these days but I'm tryin'
But then lately maybe tryin' hard just isn't quite enough
I don't have much of a story
But then maybe baby ramblin' on my just give me enough

Time to fiddle with it
Don't talk down
Time to fiddle with it
Don't talk down again

I know
I feel
Got a feeling I'll be late

And you knew this time that I'd get it
Had to prove to me that trying' hard just wansn't hard enough
Never needed me just to want ya
Had to have it all and gamble what you knew I'd written off

Time to fiddle with it
Don't talk down
Time to fiddle with it
Don't talk down again

I know
I feel
Got a feeling I'll be late

One of the reasons why I'm always delayed
Is 'cause my eight-track broke and I never get paid
But it's a long way back so don't give me no slack
I'll be there in a minute, hope my records don't crack

I know
I feel
Got a feeling I'll be late

Go-Go-Go-Go, My buddy makes some massive noise
Go-Go-Go-Go, With the flow, come on

You know that your risk is minimum, I can rap it faster than any man
What you got to do is click my name,
Check it out my special willie bounce
Wiggle wiggle it with the beat,
Make you body move and groove on the floor
You see that super sweet body reaction you feel inside
Now that music take control the night
You can dance all night long Feeling so right
Yes, that's your unlimited force
Let the rhythm pump the energy Stresses are gone The miracle night
We call it“Cyber Cyber”

The hell of boot camp, Got to move it hard like push up, push up
It's my lovely discipline, Everybody anybody do what I say
Left to the right upside down inside out, feel no tired
No wonder I can tell, You got a cyber black belt

Lean on the beat and you“full dive”

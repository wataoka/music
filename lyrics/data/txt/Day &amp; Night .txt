触れた君の唇から
伝わってた「終わり」の予感
遠くなっていく 笑ってる君は
私照らす光だった 今はもういない

You were my day あなたの温もり
You were my night あなたの声
You were my life いつまでも側で
You were my Love 触れてたかった
You were my day 激しく降る雨
You were my night 全てを消して
You were my life あなた以上に
You were my Love 誰も愛せない

君のいない右側に
いつになれば慣れてゆけるの?
君は今どこで 何を見上げてる?
約束したあの慧星 一人では見られない

You were my day あなたの温もり
You were my night あなたの声
You were my life いつまでも側で
You were my Love 触れてたかった
You were my day 激しく降る雨
You were my night 全てを消して
You were my life あなた以上に
You were my Love 誰も愛せない

You were my day あなたの温もり
You were my night 全てだった
You were my life いつまでも側で
You were my Love 触れてたかった
You were my day あんなにも深く
You were my night 愛した人
You were my life あなた以上に
You were my Love 誰も愛せない

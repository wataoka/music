Into my arms like a stranger
They opened wide just for you
But I realized there's a danger
In finally falling for you

Tell me it's already over
Something I don't understand
But I know that when it is over
I'm finally back in command

Call me the wonder of wonders
And I realize who you are
Tonight I will follow
My dreams for tomorrow
With eyes open wide here we are

Into the arms of illusion
I must be out of my mind
If there's an easy solution
It keeps getting harder to find

I know we ain't getting closer
And that's why I don't understand
That you need for this to be over
And finally back in command

Call me the wonder of wonders
And I realize who you are
Tonight I will follow
My dreams for tomorrow
With eyes open wide here we are

Call me the wonder of wonders
And I realize who you are
What if I really don't feel like a star

Call me the wonder of wonders
And I realize what I miss
Tonight I must follow
My dreams for tomorrow
With eyes open wide as it is

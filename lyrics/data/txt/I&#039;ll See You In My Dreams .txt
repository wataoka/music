Tho' The days are long, twilight sings a song,
Of the happiness that used to be.
Soon my eyes will close, Soon I'll find repose.
And in dreams you're always near to me.

I'll see you in my dreams,
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

They will light my lonely way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Because I believe what I see
It's not over yet
Keep your head up

Every single day I feel so alive Rainy days never stay
No one knows our future There's great thing I've ever seen before
What do you believe?
Sometimes life just get sick I think It's not easy to say "I'm alright"
Open your eyes and don't look back
The world is not that bad What do you see?
I'mma believe what I see I ain't never gonna be timid
What do you find in this life You're captain of your life
Because I believe...

Skies are smiling I'm standing here by myself
And I feel like I can do anything Because I believe what I see
You can't even imagine how strong you are It's not over yet
You can cry She can cry He can cry and I also...
"No pain no gain"
Don't worry! This is what you called "Natural" (You'll be alright)
Just wanna be myself
When your will is broken here's still hope You know what I mean Because I believe what I see
You don't need to act like someone else
Stay as you are...

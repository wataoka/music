Girl the way you move's got me
Going going crazy
Gotta get you now cause I'm
Fiending for you baby
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna a chance with you
I just want

Move your body faster and
Get on the dance floor and
Show me just what you got
Feelings getting stronger
Can't wait any longer and
Baby oh,
I like the way that you move

Let's hit the wall tonight
Let's hit the wall tonight

We should hit the floor and remove the space between us
Gonna give you more just to prove I really mean it
Gonna be a good good time
I just wanna lose my mind
I just want

Move your body faster and
Get on the dance floor and
Show me just what you got
Feelings getting stronger
Can't wait any longer and
Baby oh,
I like the way that you move

Let's hit the wall tonight
Let's hit the wall tonight

When I saw you dancing across the room, I knew you had to be my lady
Body shaking like Boom Boom Boom are you ready
Feel the drum beat
Like your heartbeat
Rock your body
To the party
We about to lose our minds
Are you ready?

Let's hit the wall tonight
Let's hit the wall tonight
Let's hit the wall tonight
Let's hit the wall tonight

I was sitting down in the bottom of the ocean
So dark, so cold, and so alone
Just waiting for the light that will lead me to the shore
Knowing that no light will come, without any search

Over and over thinking somehow I will be hepled
But now I have got up and started to walk
Where I can find my one strain of light
It's going to be a journey
A journey to find out

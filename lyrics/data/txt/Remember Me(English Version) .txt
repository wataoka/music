Our love was true and we didn't even know
But now the time has come to go, babe
I had to call to say I love you
And I wish that we could start anew

Our love was true we never imagined it'll end
With you I never did pretend, babe
But now I see, you mean so dear to me
When we meet again
Can we just be friends
Or will you say that you

Remember me, all the moments that we spent
You know I won't forget
How it feels to see you smile
Remember we could never be sad
I know you won't forget
You feel the same as me
I don't wanna say
Goodbye to you
But if you have to leave
Don't forget the love we shared
Please remember me

Our love was true and now you're far away
There's so much I wanna say, babe
But all I need is to have you here with me
To hear you say 
That there is a way 
And to you that youâ€¦

Remember me, all the moments that we spent
You know I won't forget
How it feels to see you smile
Remember we could never be sad
I'm sure you won't forget 
I know that's not your style
Don't make me say
Goodbye to you
And If you have to leave
Don't forget the love we shared
Please remember me

Remember me, all the moments that we spent
You know I won't forget
How it feels to see you smile
Remember we could never be sad
I know you won't forget
You feel the same as me
I don't wanna say
Goodbye to you
But if you have to leave
Don't forget the love we shared
Please remember me
Remember me

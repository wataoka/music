Dig down inside
Past all deception
You move on with your fist
And your legs
Cover the wounds
No one is laughing
So make “now” your ally
And leap before you look

If you don't trust the future
Continue with that force
What is left to learn now
So do it
And when I look there's someone
That's running by my side
Spirit inspiration
No I can't lose

Being yourself
Adding to knowledge
A new self emerges
I'm born again
Don't look behind
Run far ahead now
The past overlaps and
Is bound to follow you

No I won't
Go follow footsteps
The stereotype is breaking down

Dig inside
Revealing naked heart
Throw fear away
And now farewell so long, so long so long...

If you don't trust the future
Continue with that force
What is left to learn now
So do it
And when I look there's someone
That's running by my side
Spirit inspiration
Go get it

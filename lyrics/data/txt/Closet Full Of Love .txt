Oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh

I'm the kinda girl who likes to run away
From averything that's good that ever comes her way
But you, you make me different
No you make me stay
You impress me when you tell me not to be afraid

Most people
They just don't dig deep enough
Noooo
They only see what they wanna see
Not the real stuff

But I got drawers full of(anger?)
Boxes full of highs
And all of my unhappiness is buried alive
I got bags full of energy to bring me to life
There's a closet full of love
Closet full of love for someone to find
For someone to find(all except 1 time)

All really want is a good hand to hold
Someone to call my own
Someone to fill the holes
You could kill the emptiness that's in my soul
Not knowing if I'm always going to be alone

Most people wanna leave when in it's gets rough
They only see what they wanna see
Not the real stuff

Ooh ooh ooh oohhahah

So much is hidden inside
The black and white of my life
Maybe you're the one to find my

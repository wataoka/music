On a mountain high
［dig a hole again］
then I dream and fly away
but without you

On my knees and pray
torn apart again
I can count the reasons
but maybe the mind
deceives

There's a show in here
the things we can't express
so come inside
is it time to start moving on?
time to believe?

See the red rain here
the things we can't express
so give me my sword
oh it will be better when it's done
my eyes don't deceive
give me my sword

I can hear your voice
from the dark again
everything is underway
but without you

at the break of day
feeling whole again
I've found lots of reasons
now here's one I can
believe in

There's a show in here
the sound of my distress
a rising tide
well it might be better in the sun
time to believe?

See the red rain here
the things we can't express
so give me my sword
oh it will be better when it's done
my eyes don't deceive

There's a show in here
the things we can't express
so come inside
oh it's time to start moving on
time to believe
give me my sword

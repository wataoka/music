Lately my life's been going down
I don't know what is going on with me
body's aching everywhere
and when I speak, the words don't come out right

Friends are telling me I ain't the same
that I am starting to lose control
can't remember who I used to be
or whom I wished I could become

Baby give me just one mare chance
shine your light on my soul
take my hand forever more
for you are everything, my everything

CHORUS:
 So tell me what you want, try me babe
 I'll give you all I've got, if that's okay
 you make it seem so hard, when it's not
 and you know, you should know, no no no... just let me be

You were always so good to me
you knew exactly what was right or wrong
Is it too late to have you back?
I messed up once and now I'm down on my knees

Here's the truth, won't you hear me out
（I'm） not as strong as they think I am
Because of you I can be myself
the one I always wanna be

Baby you make my life complete
don't take the easy way out
It's now or never-oh don't you see?
let's not play that game all over again

CHORUS 2:
So tell me what you want, what you need
Take me as I am or leave me here
So what's it gonna be? It's all up to you
you and me, me and you, let it be, yeah yeah yeah

Baby give me just one mare chance
shine your light on my soul
take my hand forever more
for you are everything, my everything

CHORUS:
So tell me what you want, try me babe
I'll give you all I've got, if that's okay
you make it seem so hard, when it's not
and you know, you should know, no no no... just let me be

So tell me what you want, what you need
Take me as I am or leave me here
So what's it gonna be? It's all up to you
you and me, me and you, let it be, yeah yeah yeah

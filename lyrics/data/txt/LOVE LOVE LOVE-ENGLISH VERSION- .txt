WHENEVER I
TRY TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING I FEEL INSIDE
THE WORLDS GET IN THE WAY
AND THOUGH MY HEART HAS TRIED
LU LU LU LU LU
I WISH THAT I COULD SING IT TO YOU NOW

A LOVE SONG
LIKE THE ONE I HEAR BEFORE THE MORNING COMES
IN MY DREAMS IT ALWAYS SOUNDS SO CLEAR AND STRONG
LU LU LU LU LU
I WISH THAT YOU COULD HEAR IT TO SOMEHOW

WHENEVER I
TRY TO SHOW YOU ALL THE LOVE I FEEL INSIDE
IT NEVER SEEMS ENOUGH AND TEARS JUST FILL MY EYES
LU LU LU LU LU
I WISH THAT I COULD SAY IT BETTER NOW

I GUESS I WANT TO SAY THAT LOVE REMAINS
NO MATTER HOW TIME FADES AWAY

I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
LU LU LU LU LU
I WISH THAT I COULD SING IT TO YOU NOW
I WISH THAT I COULD SAY IT BETTER NOW

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE I SING TO YOU
LOVE I BRING TO YOU

Stay alive そう気ままに my mind when you leave
(My mind when you leave)
Still love 最後のボイスメール I'm answering for you
(I'm answering for you)

ただ胸が notice
尋ねる you see ?
数数える focus
何度も next to me
もう一度 help it
だけど you don't care
あなただけに shake it
そう いつも want you there

How many times どれほど say love you
How many days 数えきれない and...
How many tears 解き放つ go round
(n round, n round, n round)

Tell me you need me ねえ一つくらい on my own
(Why you saying that? Hey why you saying that?)
Tell me you love me ねえ続きはどこで?
(Common' take me take me home)

明日からは no tears
Baby don't you wanna see?
地図の上の コンパス
You just believe in me
もう一度 feel it
Baby worries don't care
あなただけに shake it
そう いつも want you there

How many times どれほど say love you
How many days 数えきれない and...
How many tears 解き放つ go round
(n round, n round, n round)

How many times
Go round, n round, n round

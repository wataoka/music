Summertime is here to stay.
Don't you wish that you could get away.
A camp out fire, and open car.
If only we could live this kind of life forever.

Some people smile, and some of us cry.
But it don't matter 'cause I'll be there.
To pick you up, and we'll fly together.

And maybe I'm wrong, and maybe your right.
Baby we don't have to go and get into a fight.
Beware, we'll sit around and talk together.

I close my eyes and wish that you were by my side.
I know that you' be here, laying down your smile all night.

I hope you know, I won't let go.
'Cause everything is going to be alright.
Yeah it's alright!
Don't be scared you're dreaming now baby love.
You might not know, but let me show,
That I know what you're thinking baby.
Everything is going to be alright.

Ya gotta be strong, ya gotta be fast.
Ya gotta pick up and never be last,
I'll be there, to follow you wherever you may go.
There are times you feel low, but you're never down.
Sometimes the world turns upside down.
Beware, ya only got one life to live on.

I close my eyes and wished that you were by my side.
I know that you would be here, laying down your smile all night.

I hope you know, I hope you know.
That everything is going to be alright.

You might not know, but let me show,

'Cause everything is going to be alright.

Sometimes ya feeling up, and other times you're feeling low.
You think your negativity is the only way to let it all go.
Look on the brighter side, ya never let others decide.
So never mind and kick your feet up way HIGH HIGH HIGH!

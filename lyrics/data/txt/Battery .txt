It took a spark and my heart was energized
Electrocute like a hot live wire
I looked away cause her eyes will hypnotize
An attitude that can start a fire

Baby your love's a phenomena
Tower of love rising higher higher
Gotta g-get a thermometer
Running a fever like I'm on fire

Baby it's a miracle
Something more than physical
Flow of attraction
Refraction tonight!

Running with the devil
Hot like heavy metal
Power me like a BATTERY!
I'm flying like an eagle
Sharper than a needle
Charge me up cause I need your love!

Let's get Higher Higher
Your love's like a Battery
Let's get Higher Higher

We should connect like a big capacitor
I wanna shock like a bad exposure
You flip a switch and I'm running to the floor
I wanna dance like a tra-transformer

Baby your love's a phenomena
Tower of love rising higher higher
Gotta g-get a thermometer
Running a fever like I'm on fire

Buzzing at the speed of light
Dangerous like dynamite
Passive or active
I need you tonight!

Running with the devil
Hot like heavy metal
Power me like a BATTERY!
I'm flying like an eagle
Sharper than a needle
Charge me up cause I need your love!

Let's get Higher Higher
Your love's like a Battery
Let's get Higher Higher

Now wave your hands in the air
C'mon I'm gonna take you there
Like a battery inside of me, your love is like a flare!
Wellâ€¦Keep on rocking keep on dancing
Rollercoaster, your love's a journey
Catch your heart
You cannot stop me

Running with the devil
Hot like heavy metal
Power me like a BATTERY!
I'm flying like an eagle
Sharper than a needle
Charge me up cause I need your love!

Let's get Higher Higher
Your love's like a Battery
Let's get Higher Higher

Running with the devil
Hot like heavy metal
Power me like a BATTERY!
I'm flying like an eagle
Sharper than a needle
Charge me up cause I need your love!

Let's get Higher Higher
Your love's like a Battery
Let's get Higher Higher

I'm breaking down. I am screaming out.
My time is running out. What do I do now?
Oh give up? or stand up?
I don't know. I wanna break the spell now.

I'm drowning now. 叫びはもう
輝くこと 忘れた月のようさ…
Somewhere, Lady luck will smile at me. yeah

I'm searching where you are.
Oh, shining down on me from where you are.
I'll always be right there, baby. Always be right there, baby.
Oh, please touch my body and my face.
I'm searching where you are.
Can you see what I need? It's where you are.
I'll always be right there, baby. Always be right there, baby.
You know? When I can be where you are, only then I will shine bright.

I'm crumbling down. I'm falling apart.
My time is running out. What do I do now?
Oh give up? or stand up?
I don't know. I wanna break the spell now.

落ちてゆく I'm losing myself.
震える手を 陽の当たる場所へと
Somewhere, Lady luck will smile at me. yeah

I'm searching where you are.
Oh, shining down on me from where you are.
I'll always be right there, baby. Always be right there, baby.
Oh, please touch my body and my face.
I'm searching where you are.
Can you see what I need? It's where you are.
I'll always be right there, baby. Always be right there, baby.
You know? When I can be where you are, only then I will shine bright.

歪んだ 世界の
霞んだ 空だとしても
鳥のように
I will search where you are right now.
And I will fly high.

I'm searching where you are.
Oh, shining down on me from where you are.
I'll always be right there, baby. Always be right there, baby.
Oh, please touch my body and my face.
I'm searching where you are.
Can you see what I need? It's where you are.
I'll always be right there, baby. Always be right there, baby.
You know? When I can be where you are, only then I will shine bright.

Love is a many splendored thing
It's the april rose
That only grows in the early spring
Love is nature's way of giving
A reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes, true loves a many splendored thing

Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes, true loves a many splendored thing

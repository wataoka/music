You work all your life
For success and for pride
But it never will be like you planned
You've been there done that
You're the social cat
Climbing up to the top as the star
But deep in your mind
It's making you blind

Cause you were dreaming of paradise
But your luck runs out when I through the dice
You thought you're going to paradise
Are you ready to pay?
the prize when I say
You got a one way ticket to Hell
So bye bye!

You bet all you have
To get back on the track
And it seems like it works out perfect
You're pushing for more
To be loved and adored
But you're constantly building neglect

And then you go too far
Forgetting who you are

Cause you were dreaming of paradise
But your luck runs out when I through the dice
You thought you're going to paradise
Are you ready to pay?
the prize when I say
You got a one way ticket to Hell

One way ticket to Hell
One way ticket to Hell…

It works like a charm
And making no harm

夢見たは 闇だとは

汽車はただ無情に
運命を楽しむように
ガタゴト揺れていく
知らないのはお前だけだ
恋のOne way ticket to Hell

Cause you were dreaming of paradise
But your luck runs out when I through the dice
You thought you're going to paradise

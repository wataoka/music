Sunlight
I can't remember why
We stayed up until 4AM
We talked about
Nothig important and then made love
The birds wake up we close our eyes

I love how she calls my name
Inside her dream
Kiss's me still half asleep
I wish that we could stay like this
At 8AM

Time flies
I can't remember
The first time that we met
Now I need her
Like I know she needs me too
It can't get much better then this

I love how she calls my name
Inside her dream
Kiss's me still half asleep
Don't I wish that we could stay like this
At 8AM
I stop the alarm to watch her sleep and think I'd anything
If I could make this time rewind forever
To 7:59

If I could make this time rewind

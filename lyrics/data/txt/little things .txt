I wanted to go
You wanted to stay
We couldn't make up our minds that day

You said it was cold
Then I complained
I shouldn't have laughed and walked away

It's funny how life
Can turn on a dime
Think everything's going our way

If we hadn't of fought
We'd be more than a thought
And distant memory

Now I don't know
What could have been
I won't know
'Cause we've grown into good friends
Can't turn back time
To the way it was back then
No I guess I'll never get that chance again

And now that we're old
Doesn't matter how cold
'Cause cold is a part of everyday

No sense to complain
Everyday is the same
Little things are just things that make you laugh

It's funny how life
Can turn on a dime
Think everything's going our way

If we hadn't fought
We'd be more than a thought
And distant memory

Now I don't know
What could have been
I won't know
'Cause we've grown into good friends
Can't turn back time
To the way it was back then
No I guess I'll never get that chance againâ€¦
No I guess I'll never get that chance again

That stupid man
He can't be aware of that.
Don't tell thinking aloud.

That stupid girl
She pretends a supporter.
Why do you grin now?

Hey, small fry
I said to you, too.

I'm fine with alone.
Moreover I'm not alone now.
No one can shut me.
Because this my feet is while being free.

This stupid boss
He remembers nothing.
I don't want to follow.
This stupid dog
You keep always shouting.
You're full of contradiction.

Hey, soiled mirror
I said to you, too.

I'm fine with alone.
Moreover I'm not alone now.
No one can shut me.
Because this my feet is while being free.

Hey, liar
I said to you, too.

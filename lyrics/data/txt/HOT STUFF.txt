When you hold me close
When you hold me close
When I feel your lips moving so close to mine
When I hear those words that you whisper
flowing so sweet in my ear
I want you babe take me babe
Don't stop let's get in gear

※Hot stuff, Hot stuff is your name
　You've got the moves I love the games
　Your my hot stuff I need you babe
　Come on you hot stuff man

　Hot stuff, Hot stuff is your name
　You've got the moves I love games
　Your my hot stuff I need you so bad
　Come on you hot stuff man hold me tight

Tell me your no dream
Tell me your no dream
I can feel my fire burning deep down in my heart
Everyday I wait to be near you
Waiting to be satisfied
Just call me babe I need you babe
I got this hunger inside

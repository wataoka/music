Do you know? I'm your angel
Everyday and night
I gave you a fairytale romance
Don't you know? I'm your lover
But it feels empty
Coz you never give me anything that I want

Mysterious Dance Mysterious Place
For everyone let's perform a service

Where's the Stone of miracle? Not an oracle
I've been searching forever
The power from this place breathing for 10000 years
Stone Circle is calling! This is the music! Since ancient times
I'm not alone. You are not alone
Praying!

Do you know? You're my shepherd
Lead me to the night
You gave me fantastic dreams
Don't you know? I'm your angel
But I feel falling
Coz I couldn't find the way to go

Dangerous Games Dangerous Smiles
For everyone let's join a service!

What is the Stone Circle? This is a monocle
Here is a shrine of liberty
You get power from the sky blowing for 10000 years
I feel strong magic! This is the music! Since ancient times
I'm not alone. You are not alone
Praying!

I want U to Kiss my lips
And it makes me smile every night
I want you to touch my hands
The enchanting murmurs of love

Where's the Stone of miracle? Not an oracle
I've been searching forever
The power from this place breathing for 10000 years
Stone Circle is calling! This is the music! Since ancient times
I'm not alone. You are not alone

What is the Stone Circle? This is a monocle
Here is a shrine of liberty
You get power from the sky blowing for 10000 years
I feel strong magic! This is the music! Since ancient times
I'm not alone. You are not alone
Praying!

I was dancing with a dirty blond Texan
Charming accent but the music's playing too loud for talking
So I showed him how people in the Far East get down
Push it up,push it down
Pull it up,pull it down
Keep it up,keep it down
Now put me down
...what a workout!
If you want, you can come
Come get it,get it
If you don't you may really regret it,'gret it
Up and down till your knees start shakin' shakin'
Ain't it good to be alive tonight
One life, two-time,3 girls, 4 guys
Five ripples running up and down my spine
6.0 Make it sweet, drop another dime
I was talking with a born-again Christian
"So what's it like to start life all over?"
He said"Amen,
I feel like I've been rediscovering the tomb of Tutankhamen."
Push it up,push it down
Pull it up,pull it down
Baby, don't put me down
...what a workout!
What you want, it's a done deal
Shake it,shake it
What you don't, you can forget about it, 'bout it
Up and down,feel your brainwaves jumpin' jumpin'
Makes me wanna take a dive
As we count to five
One life, two-time, 3 girls, 4 guys
Five ripples running up and down my spine
Can you hold on,someone's calling on the other line
Push it up,push it down
Pull it up,pull it down
Keep it up,keep it down
Now put me down
...what a workout!
If you want,you can come
Come get it, get it
If you don't you may really regret it, 'gret it
Up and down till your knees start shakin' shakin'
Ain't it good to be alive tonight
One life,two-time,3 girls,4 guys
Five ripples running up and down my spine
6.0 Make it sweet, drop another dime

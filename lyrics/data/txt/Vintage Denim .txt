ヴィンテージのデニムをはいてカーテンをあけたらそっと
甘いリネンに抱かれカーテンを巻くような
Wrapped in curtains I still feel the morning sound
Don't miss it,don't diss it,
I'll be waiting count it or I must go crazy

Oh,silence,bring my soul up here,
bring me up when there's nothing near
Tired of saviours that are not real
In a way that you hold,way that you hold me away

ビッグベンに明かりが見えて見上げたらそれは大きく
包み込んで この瞬間はこの街もあたたかい
Big ben it's gotta light so tenderly
and this city is warm as it's supposed to be
Listening to coldplay on the northern line
Don't miss it,don't diss it,
I'll be waiting count it or I must go crazy

Oh,silence,bring my soul up here,
bring me up when there's nothing near
Tired of saviours that are not real
In a way that you hold,way that you hold me away

冷たい風に 埃まみれの靴
Oh,silence,bring my soul up here,
bring me up when there's nothing near
Tired of saviours that are not real
In a way that you hold,way that you hold me away

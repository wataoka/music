BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

君は緑の 風に乗る
吐息まじりの Good-Times
別れるために 出逢う二人に
夏は訪れる

Oh~夢の間に間に Flower
あの頃は 帰らない
You don't understand me well
悲しみの My heart
I can cry, I don't know why

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties
BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

あの日が胸に よみがえる
恋にならない First-Sight
瞳の中で 虹のかけらを
君は抱いていた

Oh~熱い涙の Shower
俺だけの せいなのに
I will understand you well
思い出の Lovers
You can try, Let me take you fly

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

別れ話の その後は
惨めな Night Time, hum~
二度と逢えない 女性なのに
名前を呼ぶ声 I love you, oh~
(Play rock!! The guitar man
You are the number one
My lonely heart's club band)

君は誰かと 波に乗る
やがて涙の Good-Bye
見上げる空に 君のほほえみ
星がにじんでた

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

BAN BAN BAN
One day wearin' so many wears
So many chapeaux
And so many ties

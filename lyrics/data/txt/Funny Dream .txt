I had a funny dream of you and me
we're drinkin'wine along the cote d'Azur
And every where we're waiting to see and we're walkin'in the rain
I had a funny dream of you and me we never even know each other
It's getting darker for us to see what was locked up in the chains
Very tempting matter,you give me a drop of optimism
You lit the soreness to the core
And I'm waiting for the three-three-three
Not shaking any more

I had a funny dream of you, and me
we spend all day looking out the window
You smoke,I cough,you quit it all for me
and we're laughing in the shade of the tree
I had a funny dream of you, and me,and realize this is all shallow
Shallow dreams,but I can be anything for you
I wanna stay calm all the time
Very subtle matter,I say give me a drop of optimism
You take it to a brighter sky
And I'm waiting for the three-three-three
And not for any guy

Oh come on and hear me out,this is all too fast all too fast…
This is all too fast this is all too…Good!!!

I had a funny dream of you and me
we're drinkin'wine along the cote d'Azur
And every where we're waiting to see and we're walkin'in the rain
I had a funny dream of you and me we're walkin'down the avenue
We kiss and we never believe in fortune telling ladies
Very subtle matter,I say give me a drop of optimism
You take it to a brighter sky
And I'm waiting for the three-three-three

And not for any guy
And not for any guy

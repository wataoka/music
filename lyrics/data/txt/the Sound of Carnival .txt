Bye bye yesterday silent tears keep falling down, surrounding around
Bye bye yesterday can't u start to hear the sound of carnival

Many times I hesitated and sometimes I contemplated
In the end our make-believe is what was left
And the cowardice of my heart, playing it out, so mature
And so, so it goes...

Shivering heart, frozen fingertips, won't you let me hold you close
The real meaning of… the real reasons are…
the answers to all our sorrows

Bye bye yesterday, there's no special clothes to wear for our affair
Bye bye yesterday, right outside beyond the door, a carnival

Don't worry, don't worry, something's waiting for you babe...

“It's alright, I'm doin' OK, how r u, r u alright ?”
With these words u softly asked me with a smile
And your bold-hearted soul, dancing through out the night
In your dreams, seeking me

Yesterdays doubts, floating in the air, this bewildered love affair
Hiding everywhere, forget our love tale
make it disappear in this dance...

Bye bye yesterday silent tears keep falling down, surrounding around
Bye bye yesterday can't you start to hear the sound of carnival

Bye bye yesterday, there's no special clothes to wear for our affair
Bye bye yesterday, right outside beyond the door, a carnival

You hear the sound of carnival
I hear you calling
I hear the sound of carnival
I hear you calling

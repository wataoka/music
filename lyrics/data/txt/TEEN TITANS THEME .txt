When there's trouble you know who to call
Teen Titans
From their tower, they can see it all
Teen Titans
When there's evil on the attack
You can rest knowing they got your back
Cuz when the world needs heroes on patrol

Teen Titans Go!

With their superpowers they unite
Teen Titans
Never met a villian that they liked
Teen Titans
They've got the bad guys on the run
They never stop 'till the job gets done
Cuz when the world is losin' all control

Teen Titans Go!
Teen Titans Go!

If your heart is black you better watch out
You cannot escape the team
When they catch you there won't be any doubt
You've been beaten by the teens

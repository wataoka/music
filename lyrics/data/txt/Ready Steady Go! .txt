Desire and pain.
I felt many times.
I sang that persistently.
I'm sorry, the same topic.
But I'll want you to sing
tonight, too.

I won't know tomorrow.
But I have started.
Go go! ready steady go!
Can you walk together?
Or are you tired?
Did you really get me?
I found rock! I knew rock!
And I met up with you.
Go go! ready steady go!
Everyone is born
and is just dying.
Will it soon finish?

I won't know tomorrow.
But I have started.
Go go! ready steady go!
Can you walk together?
Or are you tired?
Did you really get me?
I found rock! I knew rock!
And I met up with you.
Go go! ready steady go!
I don't know your first name.
So I call so.
‘Busters!’

Everyone is born
and is just dying.
Will it soon finish?

ready steady go!
ready steady go!

Dream and despair.
That would be repeated again.
There is also actuality
I can't finish enduring.
But I'm an animal.
An animal doesn't consider suicide.
So I'll live!
Only this fact is wonderful.

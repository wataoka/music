The streets are full of PC games
The wind is cool, the folks are fine in this place
No rule, there is no groove
Too much loneliness without you on a rainy day

I'm back to the city where I was born
To think of my new life get started with you again
Wherever you are I can find you by my heart
And I hope you notice me any where

Well, say honey
I was born twice to love you again
Holding knees until yesterday
Now you are staying by my side
The setting sun is beautiful, you know it

So I told you
Nothing's true, Nothing's good
Only you and I here
If you wanna stay with me
I watch over you
To see the rising sun

A simple story
Nothing's right, Hold me tight
Only you and I here
When I wanna be with you
Can You feel the same I do
Much more than years ago
To see the rising sun with you

In my eyes, you're always
Encourage me
“Your tears will be your strength”
A desert road in the midnight town is getting blue
A coffee makes me fix my mind

Hi dear darling
Do you know when we met first night
The day I spend thinking of you
Be strong, cause you are in my mind
The shining moon is beautiful, you know it

So I told you
Something blue and makes me gloom
Only you and I here
If you wanna cry on me
I embrace you
To see the rising sun

A simple story
Something bright, See the light
Only you and I here
When I wanna hear from you
Can you send your sigh to me
Much more than years ago
To see the rising sun with you

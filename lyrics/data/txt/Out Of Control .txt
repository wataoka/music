I have copied you
and made up myself
So crash and splash

I fight
with my obsession.
I feel the tension,
a need for caution

I would like to show
Cut open my skull
Look into my head

I don't
know why I'm so harsh
I could be so brash
I'm going to clash

'cause I feel
I can always show my everything to you
If this moment was for me
I try to hear
Lend my ear
voices inside
one link to join it all
Again

All the things I knew,
the world I trusted,
would be the same
If I
remained inside my
protective castle
and kept my eyes closed

Words are just a toy
that people play with
it's superficial
I know
The proof is out there
The hidden answer
That someone left there

'cause I feel
I can always show my everything to you
If this moment was for me
I try to hear
Lend my ear
voices inside
one link to join it all

If I can
Go travel back in time
Start it all over again
Follow a calculated path to live but
One day I
Will come across the same
feeling again and know that it will carry over

'cause I feel
I can always show my everything to you
If this moment was for me
I try to hear
Lend my ear
voices inside
one link to join it all
so it goes again

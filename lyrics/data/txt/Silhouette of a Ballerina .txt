Nothing seems complicated
Simply stay the way I am
Like a wind and like the spring
I wanna be with you forever

You said my dreams come true
But you never find my mystery box
If you open bees fly out
I warn them not to talk 'bout my love

Under the new moon
Visions of miracles
Silent star from your heart
Let me stay innocent with you

Nothing to worry about
Simply stay the way I am
You're the sun and you're my air
I wanna be with you forever

My Life is unspoken
Waiting for miracles
I'm humming to so close and yet far away you

Nothing to fear about
Gently touch my destiny
Like a wind and like the spring
I wanna be with you forever

Silhouette of a ballerina
Image of my secret love
Be the sun and be my air
I wanna be with you foreve

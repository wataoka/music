Yes it's true that what you do
Is what you are
And all I want to do is you
I could be a gypsy in a travellin' band
If that's what I have to do

I've seen lots of faces but none like yours
Draws me like a moth to a flame
I feel like the prey that the predator caught
Waitin' to be slowly tamed

All my needs have been overstated
Ever since the first hello
I've never been so motivated
Here I am wrapped in thrills
I can't believe that you don't see these

Chills, from the inside out
Chills, it's a rendezvous
Chills, in another world
Chills, where you take me to...

I want you to chill me

It would be like counting every grain of sand
To match the movement in my mind
I'm gonna be close enough to hear you sigh
Cause you're given me all the time

If I could give the world
Just a bit of what you give to me
Show them what a chill can do 
They wouldn't ask me what you do for me
They'd say what can I do for you

I've forgotten what it is to be confused
Cause you've made it oh so clear
I won't be second guessing
About tomorrow's news
Cause everyday's a change
Cause you always rearrange these

Chills, from the inside out
Chills, it's a rendezvous
Chills, in another world
Chills, where you take me to...

A place where I've never been
Everyday every night
You make me feel so right...

Everyday every night baby...

I want you to chill me

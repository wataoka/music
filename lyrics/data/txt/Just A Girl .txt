Don't worry
I'll get out of your life, so don't worry
Yes, I'm gonna miss you for a while
But don't worry
I'll be fine soon, so don't worry
I'm sure you're gonna get a peaceful life
So smile

I'm just a girl who stopped by in your town
I'm just a girl who happened to like you
I'm just a girl who got to know you too well
I was just a lucky girl
just a lucky girl

Don't worry
I know I deserve this because of my ego
Hope you don't mind that I drop off a song of Dear john
Maybe I'm wrong Don't worry

You won't even fine me in your record
Because you're gonna write a million songs of your own

I'm just a girl who had the sweetest dream ever
I'm just a girl who likes to write about you
I'm just a girl who wants it all
I'm just a greedy girl
just a greedy girl

Don't worry
I promise I won't kill your soul again
Please let me close my diary of eyes on you right here

I'm just a girl who needed to be stroked when it was cold
I'm just a girl who wanted to be blind to rewind
I'm just a girl who loved you too much to touch
I'm just a stupid girl 
just a stupid girl

I'm a girl
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl

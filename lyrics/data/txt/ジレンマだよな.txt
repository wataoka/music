息が止まるくらい　胸で声がしてる
欲しいよ　今すぐ　君が…だけど

俺はずるい奴で　急にカッコつけて
傷つく自分に先回り

つくづくさ　ジレンマだよな
向かい風に叫ぶとき

★おまえに　何が出来る　抱き寄せたその後
　彼女に　何て言える　「ごめん…」って言う以外に

Whatever happens I'll take it all
However breaks my heart I must Know
This s the last in fact the last
My question that is all

Is this the love I feel selfishly
Is there a man you love still the same
Oh no, I won't eternally
Don't answer to me

Dilemma calls
Against the wind everytime
Scared, I'm feelin' so small
What can I do

What can I do what can I do for you
In your eyes I'll find someone again
What can I say what can I say to you
Sorry, the word is all that I can say

★Repeat

Sorry, the word is all that I can say

I heard that you would understand someday
But I don't live like you any way
Do I have to understand
Things I don't even want to know?

Maybe I'm just a kid now
Maybe it's just a quibble
But this is all what I want to say
Listen up! You got to hear this!

I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose
If you bring me your own theory
All right all right
Make it innocent Don't take me over!

You're gonna lose You're gonna lose
If I bring you my hundred percent hope
All right all right
Listen up! You got to hear this!

Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
This song and this voice

Maybe I'm just a kid now
Maybe it's just a quibble
But this is all what I want to say
Listen up! You got to hear this!

I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose
If you bring me your own theory
All right all right
Make it innocent Don't take me over!

You're gonna lose You're gonna lose
If I bring you my hundred percent hope
All right all right
Listen up! You got to hear this!

I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose
If you bring me your own theory
All right all right
Make it innocent Don't take me over!

You're gonna lose You're gonna lose
If I bring you my hundred percent hope
All right all right
Listen up! You got to hear this!

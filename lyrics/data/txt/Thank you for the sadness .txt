Thank you for the sadness.
Cos the happiness waiting for you
in the end of these crying days and nights.
Thank you for the sadness.
Cos I know the sun will shine
after this darkest and coldest night.

「そんな顔しないで」あきれた鏡にささやかれても
「ごめんねもう僕は誰とも笑えない」ってひねくれてたけど

Thank you for the happiness.
Cos I never thought the day like today
will come to me at last.
Thank you for the happiness.
I wonder how I feel,
if I could told this to me in the past.

Thank you for the sadness.
Cos I know I need it now,
so you don't haver to worry when I am crying.

Thank you for the sadness.
Next time the feeling comes,
I really want to hold it tight.
Thank you for the happiness.
Cos I feel like a new born
left all sad things behind.
Now I see the light.

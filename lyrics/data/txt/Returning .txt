Nothing is found here, in this place
But the world is yet there for us
Floating away in finite time
and we can never get there
As we walk under the blazing sun
we leave it behind on the way
I heard some desperate noise again
it may have been the sound of earth's rotation

※How long is it gonna take
I heard a faint voice
The man was singing “the world will end”※

But there's the promise with sun
I have to accept everything
The steady promise with the sun
You have to accept everything
The vibe is surrounding us the beautiful sound is all over us
And in the end, we will return again

Nothing is found here, in this place
But the world is yet there for us
And I will become the universe
Shoot the vibe, before I return

There is a song when I depart
There is a song when I arrive
Now is the time for us to go
Take in a deep breathe and realize

How long is it gonna take
I heard a faint voice
The man was singing “the world will end”

But there's the promise with sun
I have to accept everything
The steady promise with the sun
You have to accept everything
The vibes we shoot the notes
from the earth going around number of time
And in the end, we will return again

But there's the promise with sun
I accept everything

How long is it gonna take
I heard a faint voice
The man was singing “the world will end”

But there's the promise with sun
I have to accept everything
The steady promise with the sun
You have to accept everything
The vibe is surrounding us the beautiful sound is all over us
And in the end, we will return again

If you return, you'll find the way
You have to accept everything

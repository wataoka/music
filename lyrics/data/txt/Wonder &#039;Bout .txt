Late at night I think about you sometimes
I don't cry, I wonder if you're alright
Late at night I think about you sometimes
Wonder why I wonder if you're alright
Thinking of the love we made
Ran around, out of town, now you're back again
Confusing true love and pain
Threw it down, now I'm back on my feet again
Are you asleep
Or are you still afraid of the dark
Hugs and kisses, pictures and romances
Things that I wish I could do without
(Chorus)
How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Then again I wonder 'bout
But I don't give a damn about you
Take a bite; the pleasure is all mine
Keep in mind I'll think about you sometimes
I'm alright; I'll think about you and I'll...
Turn this plight into a singer's delight
Living in a house of pain
Ran away, and I'm glad that I ran away
Rather be out in the rain
Now I understand why my mother ran away
No use asking
When did I start acting like such a jerk (you too)
Washing dishes, birthday wishes, watching baseball matches
The other future that I wonder 'bout
So many things I wish I didn't wonder 'bout
How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Now and then I wonder but I betcha
I betcha don't give a damn about
Chorus
How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Then again I wonder 'bout
But I don't give a damn about you

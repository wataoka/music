Into the blackening night
Eyes red with black anger
Hot blood runs deep
The system's collapsing

No, no one wins
and vengeance is the only rule

Out to the blinding light
Satanic so be it
The blood run stains
The darkness insidc me

So, no one cares
And now I am the only rule now, now, now

（Die by my...）
The beast of prey
Victim of hate
（Die by my hands）

Out of the night
I shall fly
Into the sky
Where I will be free
All the tears lost
Returning with the stolen memories

Piercing the night
I will cry
Howl to the sky
For that memory
Darkness and Light
Stains the deepest Part of me

Stalking the dead of night
My veins are still boiling
In search of fate
The fist grinds on concrete
So nothing lasts
And vengeance is the only rule

Breaking the life with freight
Your fears are the answer
That cold blood calls
The darkness inslde you

So, no one cares
And now you kneel to the new rule now, now, now

（Die by my...）
In grief you pray
The price you pay
（Die by my hands）

Running the night
I tear the lies
Into the sky
Where you'll soon be free
All the lost days
Returning with the stolen memories

Out to the light
We shall fly
Into a place
Where all will be free
All that love lost
Unfolding deepest memories

Out of the night
I shall fly
Into the sky
Where I will be free
All the tears lost
Returning with the stolen memories

Piercing the night
I will cry
Howl to the sky
For that memory
Darkness and Light
Stains the deepest（Part of me）

Running the night
I tear the lies
Into the sky
Where you'll soon be free
All the lost days
Returning with the stolen memories

Out to the light
We shall fly
Into a place
Where all will be free
All that love lost
Unfolding deepest memories

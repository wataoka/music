Now the eldest oak tree found his voice
Said that her tribe had no other choice
She wondered why her kinsmen had no way
But to decay

Soon the savage ones would trample down
Her forefather's forests for renown
An aimless journey led her all around
And soon she found

All the warriors and a brilliant knight
In a bond of friendship so tight
Though she'd known them as a savage race
She had hope and joy in her pace
In the troop of humans and an elf
She would know that only herself
Would live a life
Almost eternal is her life

Though she found a true friend, they would part
Though she loved a knight, her lover's heart
Would cease to beat and she could never meet
The one again
She's to remain
Just to remain...

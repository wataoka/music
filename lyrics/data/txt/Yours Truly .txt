Dear jon,
Ive always wanted to
write a song
and dedicate it to you.
Dear jon,
I know that we have had
our little ups and downs
but managed to pull on through.
Dear jon, oh oohh

And I'll never forget all the times that we spent
strumming with our guitars.
When everything was perfect but I let it all slip away.

So I'm here
at your door
with a promise
nothing more,
to forget the mistakes
oh I'll always be
right here.
Yours truly,

Dear jon,
I love to hear the sound
of your laugh
on the phone at 2 AM.

Dear jon,
I never want all this,
all this to disappear
cuz I'd fall apart with you gone.
Dear jon, oh oohh

And I'll never forget all the times that we spent
strumming with our guitars.
When everything was perfect but I let it all slip away.

So I'm here
at your door
with a promise
nothing more,
to forget the mistakes
oh I'll always be
right here.

And that cold winter night
when I pushed you away
still burns inside of me.
But then I see the light,
when you look my way,
and I pray that you might see.

That I'm here
at your door
with a promise
nothing more,
to forget the mistakes
oh I'll always be
right here.
Yours truly,

Ooh
Always
Always
Yeahhh
Yours trulyâ€¦

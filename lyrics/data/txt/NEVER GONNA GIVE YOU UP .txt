Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down

Can you 気づいてる?
こんなにも Crazy over you
君にめぐり逢った その瞬間から
Together we share this love so strong

Whenever you touch my body
言葉にならない
Cause the love you give's so good
Whispers that you love me
心で感じたい
I can feel your touch inside

There is nothing I won't do
In this life I'll wait for you Yeah
You know There is nothing I won't do
In this life I'll wait for you Yeah

目覚めた心が
溢れてく So much more
I dream of you every night
傷ついてもいい
同じ夢を見たいから

Whenever you touch my body
信じていたいよ
Cause the love you give's so good
Whispers that you love me
君の声だけは
I can feel your touch inside

[Rap]
I can see it in your eyes what you're sayin
Believe in me, girl you know I ain't playin
In love with you from the very start
beyond a shadow of a doubt never gonna break your heart

You freak me out when we're hangin at night
And you whisper the words "Baby I Like"
There's one thing in life I can guarantee
from Mike A. to Mai K forever will be

There is nothing I won't do
In this life I'll wait for you Yeah
You know There is nothing I won't do
In this life I'll wait for you Yeah

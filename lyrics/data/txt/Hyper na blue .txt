君の憂鬱は 深く沈んだ青 僕を沈めて息もさせない
突破口などなく 上手く抜け出せない今夜も I swear

冷たくなった指先で 僕に触れる
やましさなどない そう言い聞かせて
沈黙の先は とても見つけ出せない 本音は I go out

Did I do something to you? hyperな blue
Did I do something to you? きっと
Did I do something to you? 長い夜の果てへ
Did I do something to you?

Cry cry
Cry cry What did I do to you?
Cry cry
Cry cry cry cry

黒い尻尾を掴んだつもりなら どうしようもなく罵倒してくれ
体当たりしなきゃ 太陽は昇らない 覗き込まれた瞳の奥さえとらわれ

Did I do something to you? hyperな blue
Did I do something to you? ずっと
Did I do something to you? 厚い闇の向うへ
Did I do something to you?

Did I do something to you? hyperな blue
Did I do something to you? ずっと
Did I do something to you? 今夜抜け出せない
Did I do something to you?

Did I do something to you?
Did I do something to you?
Did I do something to you?

Did I do something to you?
Did I do something to you?
Did I do something to you?

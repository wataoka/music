Who are you
You had always been close to me
Where are you
You had shown me the ways to see

From over the ocean
Times when I cried
And from the high skies
When I wanted to die

And now you're beginning
To show me the rules
Of this great universe
To show me the truth
Of this universe
In which I strive to live

Is it Love
Or is it nothingness, what could it be
But I know
That you'll always be leading me

Come to me now
Please guide me through,
All my life
I'm gonna need you true

Who sre you
I guess I'll never leam
Who or what you may be
But one thing's for sure
Without any doubt
Your child I must be

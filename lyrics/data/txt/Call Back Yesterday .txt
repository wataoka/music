If you're lost 
Listen to your heart's saying well 
Could it be 
A better chance just to start it all again 
If you're worn 
Listen to desire which lies deep inside of your heart 
Time to start to bring back the feeling

Call back yesterday 
When your life's like a melody 
In a rhythm you found the joy 
You can't deny it all
So you bring back memories 
Here comes again   Your day
Life goes on 
Keep your dreams because the sky's the limit 
Love yourself 
With all precious memories

When they're cold 
Don't you care about what they tell 
You can be what you wanna be 
You know you'll make it 
When they win 
Let them win again 
"Wait and see" brings some other chance 
Life is a dance touched by celebrations

Call back yesterday 
When your life's like a melody 
In a rhythm you found the joy 
You can't deny it all
So you bring back memories 
Here comes again   Your day
Life goes on 
Keep your dreams because the sky's the limit 
Love yourself 
With all precious memories

Ah...........

Every tale has an ending
In this life we are spending
（you）Say hello than goodbye
（It）made you laugh, but now it's making you cry

You've been taking your chances
Trying to look for the answers
But you can't understand
Wishing you could feel the touch her hand

Living on the memories that you make
Giving only so that you can take
Whatever road you're on
It won't be long
Then soon it will dawn a brand new day

＊Take the pain in your heart
　Make it into a dream
　More beautiful
　Than you've ever known before

＊＊I'll be there by your side
　　I have been waiting for someone like you
　　To share the journey to a brand new day

In a world ever-changing
Everyday rearranging
It can be hard to face
Challenges that life is throwing your way

When the day turns to nighttime
And you can't find the right rhyme
Every choice that you make
Leads you to another sorry mistake

Living on the memories that you make
Giving only so that you can take
Whatever road you're on
It won't be long
Then soon it will dawn a brand new day

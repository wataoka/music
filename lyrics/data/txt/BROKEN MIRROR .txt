Don't be afraid
No one can tear us apart
A look around
You'll never feel alone
You're my twin
We never come to terms forever

Who's gonna take you home
Don't wanna stay so long
All of my life I've felt like dying
Don't wanna stay so long

I'm gonna fix your rules
You better look alive
You're better off alone
You better back off now
You better back off now
Don't wanna fall apart
You know I won't back down
Nobody left to blame

Don't be afraid
Into the hands of fate
A look around
The other me is you
You're my queen
What do you think I have to follow

Been waiting for so long
Who's gonna rise the road
I never knew love till I met you
Who's gonna rise the road

I'm gonna fix your rules
Nobody hold you down
You're better off alone
You better back off now

You better back off now
Never go back again
You better back off now
Before the sky falls down

Turning into dust and fade away
Just can't seem to get you out of my brain

I realize
What I am fighting for
Until the end
I'll live inside of you
So I can see
Standing in front of a broken mirror
Who's gonna take you home
It's gonna feel real good
All of my life I've felt like dying
It's gonna feel real good

I'm gonna fix your rules
You better look alive
You're better off alone
You better back off now
You know I won't back down
You better back off now
Don't wanna fall apart
Nobody left to blame

Turning into dust and fade away
Just can't seem to get you out of my brain

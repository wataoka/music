Don't care anymore
What did you remember another day
There were just the facts
Until the end of the show

褪せた答えに戸惑っていたんだ
でも未完成なそれぞれを探り合い
空虚な心満たそう
What we talked about
Still we never end

We just stopped our tears from falling
Cheers to the light
Learning from rhythm of your life
手にしても消せないだろう
過去の君がしてきた事も
日々ありのままを進み行けば
多くを忘れてく 怖れずにもう
Could you bring me one?
Become more and more interested in
The flux of time

Don't care anymore
What was I faking other day
Tell me what's the truth
Under the reason behind the scene

Carry on again
The cross became undone now
Let me know when
We'll have a conversation at

月の光に溺れていたんだ
ただ不安定なこの夜を抜け出せ
空虚な心剥がそう
What we talked about
Still we never end

We just stopped our tears from falling
Cheers to the light
Learning from rhythm of your life
手にしても消せないだろう
過去の君がしてきた事も
日々ありのままを進み行けば
多くを忘れてく 怖れずにもう
Could you bring me one?
Become more and more interested in
The flux of time we want

理不尽な状況で宵が深ける度仰ぐ
言葉少なに冷めて帰路に着いた
愚かな祈りだと知って

Stopped our tears from falling
Cheers to the light
Learning from more rhythm of your life
今だけは消せないだろう
泣いても見えたあの景色へ
全て受け入れてく世界には
雨が堕ちて来たんだろう
気付かずにそう
Could you bring me one?
Become more and more interested in
The flux of time
Become more and more interested in
The flux of time we want
Hey steal what's you wanna chord

Stop everything
To say goodnight
The morning sky
And then, the start of day
I know we're lost today
Along the road
I said, I know we're lost today
But no...

Say "seize the day"
Untie this suit
And take me home
And then, just stay with me now
Standing far across the room
And all alone
I'm standing almost next to you
Alone...

Say that we'll really last rest of our lives
Say here is the place, we call home
Say this is the hope that I need
Say here I will stand with you
And I came through
And I still come through

Still there's these things
That make me laugh
The way you came home
And then, we start again
A lot are lost these days
Along the road
I said I'm not as lost today
From you...

Stay soft and clean
And keep us on
You help me through
And then, you drive me crazy
Standing far across the room
And all alone
I'm standing almost next you
Alone...

Say that we'll really last rest of our lives
Say here is the place, we call home
Say this is the hope that I need
Say here I will stand with you
And I came through
And I still come through

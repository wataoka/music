Katie Casey was baseball mad
She had the fever and she had it bad
Just to root for the hometown crew
Every cent that Katie spent

On one Saturday her young boy
Called to see if she'd want to go
To see a show but Ms. Kate said no
I'll tell you what you can do

Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
I don't care if I ever get back

Cause it's root root root for the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out
At the old ballgame

Katie Casey saw all the games
Knew the players by their first names
Told the umpire he was wrong all along
And she was strong

When the score was two to two
Katie Casey she had the clue
To cheer on the boys she knew just what to do
She made everyone sing this song

Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
I don't care if I ever get back

Cause it's root root root for the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out
At the old ballgame

Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
I don't care if I ever get back

Cause it's root root root for the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out
At the old ballgame

Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out with the crowd
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
I don't care if I ever get back

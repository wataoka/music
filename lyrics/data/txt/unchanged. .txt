陽がまた昇りし刻 蝋は
浅緋へとDissolve
東の空、翔ける鳥は
残像(かげ)なき嘆(こえ)をLeave

生き逝く日を託つとも
Can't be changed.
いま、わたしに
出来ることがただ護りゆく愛

The unchanged is the power of love, the power of love,
The unchanged is the power of love, the power of love,
If the times change.

水鏡に浮かびし世は
徒然なりDespair
東の空、掛ける帳は
しほたる刻をLeave

生きとし者の宿命(さだめ)は
Can't be changed.
いま、あなたに
伝えるべき諸行無常の愛

The unchanged is the power of love, the power of love,
The unchanged is the power of love, the power of love,
If the times change.

All destinies draw a spiral.
That seems to be a cellular arrangement.
Do not change. From the ancient age, everything.
All destinies draw a spiral.
That seems to be a cellular arrangement.
Do not change. We met at this age.

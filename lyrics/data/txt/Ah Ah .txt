All the girls, wish to be sexy
Pretty red dresses & high heels
Put lip stick on and make me high
How gorgeous I am

I really love myself
Let's just be super cute girls
I don't need expensive things
You want me but you can't have it

Lady come on join the party “dance dance”
Show me how you're“moving”
They have a crush on you
Baby you're enslaved by my charm“no no”
I don't mind“ah ah”
Nobody can stop me

Most of the girls wanna have fun
Going to clubs in the night time
My mom was always angry at me
But when she was young, she was hot!!

I love myself
Let's just be super cute girls
I don't need expensive things
You want me but you can't have it

They gave me diamond ring “bling bling”
But they're nothing“to me”
Cause I'm much much more
Yes, you can't buy me “no no”
Different from“the others”
Nobody can stop me

Feel your heart pounding loudly now
Flowers swaying to ease all worries
Take a giant step into the land of make believe
One sun hovers high above us all

Thousands of days around the world
Imagine all people with their hands raised
Suddenly with arms down bonding shoulder to shoulder
Show a little love and come together now

We can do it now
Meet the world with an embracing heart Nothing can ever stand in your way
We all unite like all good ska music

Shout great pleasures
Chant in union To reach the skies
Wishes answered and your dreams come true
We all unite like all good ska music

Feel your heart pounding loudly now
Flowers swaying to ease all worries
Take a giant step into the land of make believe
One sun hovers high above us all

Come together as all good ska is one
Come together as all good ska is one

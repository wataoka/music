Softly, you whisper my name
I hear it
Gently, you call out my name
But when I turn around
I see you're no where to be found

But still I feel your existence in flame
I know it
Some how, you're just not the same
And when you're undercover
I'm always fast to realize

Fantasies, my imaginations go wild
You give me mysteries, I can tell when you've lied
Still I see no answer in your eyes

Give me your secrets
Help me color my dreams
I need your secrets
Let me see the unseen
Give me your secrets
Help me color my dreams
I want your secrets
Let me uncover your scheme...

Softly, you whisper my name
I hear it
Gently, you call out my name
But when I turn around
I see you're no where to be found

Fantasies, my imaginations go wild
You give me mysteries, I can tell when you've lied
Still I see no answer in your eyes

Give me your secrets
Help me color my dreams
I need your secrets
Let me see the unseen
Give me your secrets
Help me color my dreams
I want your secrets
Let me uncover your scheme...

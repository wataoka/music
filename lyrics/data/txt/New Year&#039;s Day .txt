Seven years have passed so quickly And it seems like yesterday
I remember your phone call It was the last day of that year
We bought a cheap wine Girls at the backseat
Car stereo was playing so loud
My stupid songs My stupid words never change

I don't forget the promise we made
Still the same star shines above us
Driving 45 to see fireworks on New Year's Day

I'm tired of being told to be someone I never wanted to be
I'm so sick to hear prigs talking about sociability
I've never forgotten why I started this rebellion myself
My stupid songs My stupid words never change

I don't forget the promise we made
Still the same star shines above us
Driving 45 to see fireworks on New Year's Day

I just can't wait Life is too short
Time is running too fast and I'm always left behind
I just can't wait Until my turn
I never asked for authority to do in my own way

Hell I don't forget the promise we made
Still the same star shines above us
Driving 45 to see fireworks on New Year's Day

Driving 45 to see fireworks on New Year's Day

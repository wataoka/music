When the sun pours down like honey
From the sweet California sky
Then the haze and the smog they are both soon forgotten

And it's the very same way with love now
When you're hurtin from an old affair
Then the pain will disappear when a new love's gotten

Don't ask me why I do it
Cause you'll only say I knew it
And I'm played just like a fool everytime(everytime)
Oh but if you know the answer
Then I won't even ask her
Cause it's hard enough for me to go down one more time

When it's 10 a.m. in Doraville
It's only 7 a.m. in L.A.
She said I didn't want to wake you up just to warn you
So the taillights soon will ficker
And the Georgia sun will rise
But I'll be in the dark in California

Oh I'm a two-time loser
And that could sober up any boozer
Or at the very least make him looser
In his prime
And I never even called her
So why does everyone say I balled her
I don't think I have the energy to go down one more time

Please don't say that it's magic
Cause it always ends up tragic
The act of love so sweet so soon becomes a crime(becomes a crime)
Oh please don't make me taste it
Though it seems such a shame to waste it
I don't think I have the energy to go down one more time

One more time, one more time
One more time

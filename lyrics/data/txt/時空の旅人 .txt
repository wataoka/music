I've seen you somewhere
Such a long long time ago
But I don't know when
Your beautiful face and hair
That I think I really touched some time
It's all so familiar

You don't have to say
Nothing, nothing to explain
I feel the same sweetness just like before
You may have been my true love
God only knows where we came from

Everything on Earth
Can be reincarnated
So are we, over and over
Even if I'm killed
There's no need to be afraid in tears
Listen to me

You don't have to cry
Nothing, nothing to regret
I know we'll reunite beyond time
The future is always waiting for the two of us
Eternally…
So please oh please, kiss me again

We were made to be Time Strangers
Movin' on across the universe

You don't have to cry
Nothing, nothing to regret
I know we'll reunite beyond time
The future is always waiting for the two of us
Eternally…
So please oh please, kiss me again

Woo come closer
So please oh please, kiss me again

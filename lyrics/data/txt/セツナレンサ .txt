I was about to fall into this place where I can never crawl up
I should've been to Hollywood and meet Eddie Murphy and say
'tike tike yo tike tike yo kiddy yo Hi Mr. Please entertain us'

Why am I be the only bitch who's sick and black of this shit and flak
And why do you asking me this homey quiz
Hitchhike, which type? Which kind of music
Whether hiphopopopari-rock' n' roll techno disco? Let go now, cut it out
Why that I should be such a fan of me why? Why? Why? Why?

I am about to fall into this puddle I can never crawl up
I've already been to Hollywood and met Eddie Murphy he said
'Chili-chili-out-chil-chili-out kiddy yo'here's a quarter buy yourself a grave

Why should I have to explain this shit each time this mind devise this sight
And why that I have to analyze? Inside this mind designs this style
Talila talila talilalilalila Galileo Galilei, honey where the heck am I?
Mind if I could be one of your enemies Mind? Mind? Mind? Mind?

楽しくないのに僕たちは 心に黙って笑えるから
悲しくないのに僕たちは どこからか涙流せるから

Hey, dear my friend I want you to be, as I want you to be, indeed
You know why? You know why well then ask in your mind
Now I'm tired to make an agree
Hey, dear myself I want you to be, as you wanted to be, indeed
Oh, by the way oh, by the way oh, by the way do as what I say

昨日守ってたナニカをね 明日は壊してしまうけど
昨日交わした約束もね 明日は破ってしまうけど

今の僕は ここにいるよ 大事な人もいるんだよ
守っている約束もね 今は 今は 今は あるよ

優しくないけど僕たちは 誰かを守ってみたいんだ
寂しくないけど僕たちは 誰かと笑っていたいんだ

虚しくないのに僕たちは まん丸い月を見上げるのは
誰かに僕を見ていてほしい 嘘つきな僕を見ていてほしい

切なくないのに僕たちは 悲しい歌聴きたくなるのは
誰かに僕が似ていてほしい 嘘つきな僕に似ていてほしい から

Hey, dear my friend I won't let you know, or I won't try to show how I feel
You know why? You know why well then ask in your mind
Now I'm tired of being admired
Hey, dear myself don't leave me alone don't ease me along how I feel
You know why? You know why well then ask in your mind
In your mind is my mind otherwise who am I?

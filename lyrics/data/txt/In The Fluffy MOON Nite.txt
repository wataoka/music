※To be in your lap, I'm stalking behind.
　To be pawed all over me.
　Water color lights are pursueing after my shadow.
　I stay in your wrap, I'm purring gently
　To be in my space of you.
　In my mind I can see me with you smile.
　I will be happy the rest of my life.

Meow! Can you hear me in your dream?
I have so much to tell you.
Believe me, with you I won't miss out.
Meow! Can you take me to your days?
I was born with nine lives
Somewhere in the night, Some are just meant to be.

You can show me how to hold
Time come my way, night opened for me.
How is that so?

※Repeat

Meow! Miracle you made for me.
The life come between us
Sometime in the spring, Some are just meant to be.

Now I know I had looked for
Aim came my way, night opened gates for me.
How is that so?

To get in your lap, I'm pretending to remembering all of you.
Water color moon is wondering over you and me.
To get in your arms I'm purring softly
To let you know I am already close to you
You can feel me, I always love to be in your arms.

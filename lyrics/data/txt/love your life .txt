Oh, it's so beautiful
Just to be living today
Don't you know it's beautiful
To talk to people everyday

It's alright, ridin' around in the breeze
If you live the life that you please
So happy to be alive
So happy to be alive
So happy to be alive

What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
I just got to say
I just got to say
If you love your life
You won't need to cry anymore

Oh, it's so beautiful
Everybody's free
Don't you know it's beautiful
I'll sing my song to you

Come along and I'll show you how
All you have to do is live for now
So happy to be alive
So happy to be alive

What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
I just got to say
I just got to say
If you love your life
You won't need to cry
If you love your life
You won't need to cry anymore

So happy to be alive
So happy to be alive
So happy to be alive

What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
I just got to say
I just got to say
What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
What a good good feelin' this morning
I just got to say
I just got to say
If you love your life
You won't need to cry
If you love your life
You won't need to cry
If you love your life
You won't need to cry anymore

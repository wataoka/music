One hot summer day, we met on the beach. The sound of the waves was music to
our ears. I was w/you only. For one summer, but I still think about you.
Summer is almost over from the radio I can hear the love song we use to listen to.
It was the kind of love anybody might experience. But now, it's gone
disappeared into the waves w/the pearl necklace. The time we spent together
is now my very precious memory. Where did you go? Mr.playboy. When I listen to
this song, it feels like you're right next to me, lying down together w/yr arms
around me. The boy I loved, you will always, always be in my heart.

Alright baby, what is it now?
I know that this silence is telling me
That you got something on your mind
That's gonna break my heart
That's gonna break my heart

Alright baby, I understand
We are so distant
There's no way that our love is gonna make its way ok
So I wan't beg you to stay
No, I wan't beg you to stay

'Cause I don't want you to hate me, please
I don't want you to hate me
I don't want you to hate me
So I'll hold my fists down
I'll hold it to myself

Alright baby, it's over now
And you got to hit the point
So that I can fly away from you
But you hugged me and my tears, how dare you?
You hugged me and my tears

'Cause you don't want me to hate you, isn't that right?
You don't want me to hate you
You don't want me to hate you
So you try to sympathize
But you'll never know I feel

Get out of me
Get out of me now
Such a liar, liar,
For once, but true to my heart and I wanna shout your name out loud

Oh please don't hate me, please
I don't want you to hate me
I didn't want you to hate me
So I held it all to myself
I'm breaking from inside now

Don't hate me, don't hate me, don't hate me
Don't hate me, don't hate me, don't hate me

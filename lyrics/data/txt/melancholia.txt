life is sorrow
life is beautiful

go down go down
it's so cold, it's so deep

fly across the wind
fly over the rainbow

the teardrops are drifting in the air
I've melted in your eyes
melancholic moment

...kiss my eyes...kiss my cheek...
...fall me...
...I feel I feel......only sweet moment
...dream into the water,...I feel...I feel...

touch my lips
touch my finger

please tell me, tell me
it's a endless story

life is sorrow
life is beautiful

the moonlight is shining in the silence
I've melted in your（arms）eyes
melancholic memories

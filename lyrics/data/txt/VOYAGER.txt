Come on baby do the rock and roll
The moon is high and the suns just coming down
Come on baby are you rock and rollin'
Let me take you to a futureland

Fly on a magical ride
Huntin' for paradise

※From dark night until twilight
　There ain't nobody who can stop us now
　Find the light the brightest starlight
　Wow yeah….you'll wanna go there one more time

　Rock and roll! Can you feel it now
　Just spin around
　We're goin' around and around

　Like a ball! Are you movin' now
　Just spin around
　We're rollin' like a rolling stone

The world keeps spinning around
God it's you yeah

Ride on time are you ready to go
The heat is high and my friends are coming down
I got chills and it's multiplyin'
'Cuzz I can feel the future waitin' for us

Fly on a magical ride
There is a paradise

Chase the light till morning sunlight
We'll find a future where the sun goes up
Find the answer with your own eyes
Wow yeah, there's a world that waits to be found

※※Rock and roll! Can you see it now
　　Just spin around
　　We're goin' around and around

　　Like a ball! Is it happening now
　　Just spin around
　　We're rollin' like a rolling stone
　　The world keeps spinning around
　　God it's you

Fly on a magical ride
Fly on a magical ride
Huntin' for paradise

The sun has come and gone, look for the shining star
Everybody's thinking about the time when they used to shine
It's sad, but true
But then again the sun will rise again

The moon is here to stay, it's time for me to pave the way
No one here is thinking about the time when they used to dream
It's sad, but true
I'm standing still and calling out for you

Dear, come back to the place of our memories
Dear, please listen to me
Please don't forget there will always be a place for you here
My dear, we miss you

The time slowly comes, but then again it goes again
I'm just here thinking about the time when we used to be
It's sad, but true
I'm standing still and calling out for you

Dear, come back to the place of our memories
Dear, please listen to me
Please don't forget there are people here waiting for you
My dear, we miss you

赤く染まった陽を“夕暮れ”という
眩しい光を“あなた”という

Dear, come back to the place of our memories
Dear, please listen to me
Please don't forget that I'm standing here calling for you
My dear, we miss you

I miss you

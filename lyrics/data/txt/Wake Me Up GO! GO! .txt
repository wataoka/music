You put the boom boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high when your loving stars
Jitterbug into my brain
Goes a bang bang bang till my feet do the same

If something's bugging you If something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleeping in my bed
I was dreaming but I shoud have been with you instead

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high

You put the grey skies out of my way
You make the sun shine brighter than doris day
You turn a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on baby lets not fight
We'll go dancing everything will be alright

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high

Cuddle up baby move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there but its warm in bed
They can dance, We'll stay home instead

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high

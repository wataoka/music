SIX DAY WANDER
I SAW A MONOCHROME RAINBOW
SIX DAY WONDER
EVERYTHING LOST ITS TRUE COLOR

透き通った眼の奥に映した世界の終わりを

SIX DAY WANDER
I TRIED TO REACH FOR YOU
SIX DAY WONDER
MELODIC STORM WENT AROUND THE WORLD

偽りのない心を壊した欠片は砂になって
風が運んで 新しい朝にやがて降り積もるだろう

WHEN THE GREEN RIVER HAS FROZEN OVER
I'LL CROSS THE RIVER AND FOLLOW YOUR FOOTMARKS
WHEN THE WIND BRINGS TRUE COLORS BACK TO THE WORLD
YOU'LL LOOK THROUGH MY EYES AND DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY

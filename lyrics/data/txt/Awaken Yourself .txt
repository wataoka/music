Time to open up yourself Try to look into yourself
見た事も無い自分に気付いて
Don't you wanna make a change in you?
Take a little step into my world
新しい何かを見つければいい

Let go all the things you have 不満ばかり並べても
Thinking all night, worrying 'bout your life 眠れないだけ
Let go all the rules you have どうせ儚き夢なら
Though you wake up from the dreams you had 躊躇(ためら)わないで

Everything you do 君が欲しいものは全部
Whatever you desire and aspire 何もかもここにあるから

Time to open up yourself Try to look into yourself
見た事も無い自分に気付いて
Don't you wanna make a change in you?
Take a little step into my world
新しい何かを見つければいい

Show me what you got inside 体中満ちあふれる
Never ever, it will never stop もう止まらない
Show off what you got for me ほとばしるほど弾けて
Don't you ever be the way you were 乱れるままに

Everything you need それは欲望の切れ端
Whatever you acquire and require 混ざり合えば分かるはずさ

Time for you to be awake Open up to see yourself
素肌にキツく張り付いた愛で
Don't you wanna fly up high with me?
Just a little jump into my heart
ありえないほど遠くまで飛ばせ

Time for you to be awake Open up to see yourself
素肌にキツく張り付いた愛で
Don't you wanna fly up high with me?
Just a little jump into my heart
ありえないほど遠くまで飛ばせ

Time to open up yourself Try to look into yourself
見た事も無い自分に気付いて
Don't you wanna make a change in you?
Take a little step into my world
新しい何かを見つければいい

Another trophy won
But something's lost
Your world collapses
My heart turn numb

Triumph for what
Zero hope, none
Tell me the way to get out
If you find one

I call your name
You seek for love
Know where it is?
I got news for you

Roads too far apart
Answer the question
Is there anything to fight for?

I don't remember
No, I don't recall
Yeah, I don't remember
But I know I need it

The lights go down
I search the flame
Scream into the night
It's you I crave

The system's down
The mind blacks out
Maybe We might wake up
In another world

Our desperate hearts
What used to be love
Please tell me yours is not the one

I lose my grip
What was the cause
Hold on to your hope
If you have one

I don't remember
No, I don't recall
Yeah, I don't remember
But I know I need it

One Faith, 
That is all we need
One Light,
That will show the way
What went wrong?
Hope was so close to our hearts
Won't someone tell me please?

I don't remember
No, I don't recall
Yeah, I don't remember
But I know I need it

I don't remember
No, I don't recall
Yeah, I don't remember
But I know I need it

You've got some nerve coming out here
Into the eye of the storm
with a noose 'round your neck
Knowing that you're going to be dead
What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine
No choice in matter everything's fine
If you stay where you were
Obey Don't think Consume
Don't even start to assume
I know I got what you need
Evacuate to the underground
This is no place for you
Iknow I got what you need
IknoW I got what you need
Iknow I got what you need
Iknow I got it but its MINE

You've got some nerve coming out hiere
Into the eye of the storm
with a noose 'round your neck
Audacity at its best
You've got no place torun
You've got no place hide
Your smell is groping my tongue
Obey Don't think Consume
The sign is right in front of you
I know I got what you need
but it doesn't mean a thing to me
I know I got what you need
but it doesn't mean a thing to me
I know I got what you need

You've been warned you little rat
And I'm out on the kill

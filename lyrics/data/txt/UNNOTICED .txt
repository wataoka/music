You got my head spinning and flipping over backwards
You play over and over in my mind
Sometimes I don't know if you  even know that I'm alive

It's time to make you see that you should get my number
I'm gonna make you turn your head around
When I know what I want there's nothing that could keep me down
Turn around........

NO I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO'S GONNA BE DENIED
STANDING IN THE SHADOWS WHILE LIFE  FLIES BY
TIME TO STEAL THE THUNDER CAUSE IT'S MY SHOW
AND I WON'T GO UNNOTICED

So sue me if I wanna make a million dollars
To stake your claim ya gotta stand up tall
When I get you baby ya know I'm gonna share it all

I'll be your snow flake in the middle of a heat wave
When you're cold I'll be your summer sun
One thing for sure baby with me i know that you'd have fun
So c'mon on on on

NO I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO'S GONNA BE DENIED
STANDING IN THE SHADOWS WHILE LIFE FLIES BY
TIME TO STEAL THE THUNDER CAUSE IT'S MY SHOW
AND I WON'T GO UNNOTICED

Bridge:
Look at me
You will see

CAUSE I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO'S GONNA BE DENIED
STANDING IN THE SHADOWS WHILE LIFE GOES BY
GOTTA STEEL THE THUNDER WHEN ITS YOUR SHOW
NO I WONT GO.......

IM NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO'S GONNA WAIT AROUND
NOTHING THIS LIFETIME'S GONNA KEEP ME DOWN
TIME TO STEEL THE THUNDER CAUSE ITS MY SHOW
GONNA LET YOU KNOW
ONE THINGS FOR SURE
I WILL NEVER GO .......... UNNOTICED!

I've been watching you the whole night THROUGH
Moonlight in your hair, you're BEAUTIFUL
Dancing like an ANGEL
My hearts in DANGER
Don't stop, Let's GO,
Now watch me I'ma ROCK the FLOOR

Ah ah ah - Chiki chiki… break

Tonight, Feels right & 君 以外に用はない
Set my secrets free on with the music Release in the air

いつだって my heart GROOVES right into YOU
どうすれば LOVE 音のように I want you feel it TOO

Cause愛 なんて don't come like the BREEZE
Under the mirror BALL
Give me a chance LADY,
今夜こそは爆音でIt's yours BABY

ビートよこせ Hit 12& 3
ベース飛ばせ Now let me BE
フロアーのGANGSTER
Make me your ROCK STAR

Don't stop, Let's GO,
Now listen PASS the MICROPHONE

Tonight, Feels right & 君 以外に用はない
Set my secrets free on with the music Release in the air

いつだって my heart GROOVES right into YOU
どうすれば LOVE 音のように I want you feel it TOO

Cause愛 なんて don't come like the BREEZE
Under the mirror BALL
Give me a chance LADY,
今夜こそは爆音でIt's yours BABY

BABY LISTEN CAN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC_
MOVE YOUR BODY TO THE BEAT & BASE LICK_
YOUR LOVE IS SO ELECTRONIC
CONNECTING TOGETHER WE WILL WORK OUT PERFECT

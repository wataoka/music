I'm not cracking up
Fighting for myself
Choosing with my hand
Don't push against my way

Shadows of the past
Holes in the darkness
Failures I've made
But I change them back to zero
(Shout out) (Shout at my life) (let me go home)

風は明日へまた未来乗せては
果てた祈りさえ繋いで見せた
決して掻き消される事も無く
闇を照らす光と成り行く

Time is losing goals
The rampage never stops
Greed is swelling out
The times lacked feeling

Reasons I've lost
Finding another way
Voices in my heart
Now I change them back to zero
(Shout out) (Shout at my life) (let me go home)

空は先立つもの映しては
今が持つ意味を伝え続けた
厚き雲の上の青空が
見えるその日まで時計回して

(Do you find meaning in a system that pretends to
give you hope?)
(Our screams are tearing our values into pieces)
(We must find our answers)
(So let us go now)

All I wanna do is see the only truth
Now I'll never let you give up sunny days
Time is waiting for us
Life is calling to you
So I wanna let you go on your way
Go on your way
Finding your way
Finding your way
Turn on your light

Burn out again
Burn out again
Open your way
Open your eyes
To overcome regrets
(Shout out) (Shout at my life) (let me go home)

風は明日へまた未来乗せては
果てた祈りさえ繋いで見せた
決して掻き消される事も無く
闇を照らす光と成り行く

風は止まなく (Remember big blue skies)
花は枯れずに (Above the clouds you saw)

順風を望み描き日跨いで
枯れた声よ光と成り行け

Change! For Change!
と騒ぐ
この世は loosing it's control
Get up! Get up!
と急ぐ
どこまでも as fast you go

昨日を振り返る
May be for another day
答えはみえない
You're telling me to walk your way

Up & Down
Down & Up
yeah, let it go around
Let it go around
Right & Left
Left & Right
yeah, let it go around
Let it go around

Ok! Ok!
慌てず
ゆっくりと finding my own way
Go far! Go far!
行けるさ
信じてる dreams come true

明日を夢見る
Today's for a better day
君へと繋がる
I'm walking oh my own way

Up & Down
Down & Up
yeah, let it go around
Let it go around
You & Me
We're down together
Let it go around
Let it go around
君へと
Let it go around
繋がる
Let it go around

どの波も受け入れたなら
Oh the top of wave
見つけられるよ
Fly, oh fly

Up & Down
Down & Up
yeah, let it go around
Let it go around
Right & Left
Left & Right
yeah, let it go around
Let it go around

Up & Down
Down & Up
yeah, let it go around
Let it go around
You & Me
We're down together
Let it go around
Let it go around...
君へと
Let it go around
繋がる
Let it go around

It's really windy today
Are you ready or not for fly
We set out to reach the summit of a mountain
Are you ready or not for fly
The snowboard season has come!
Here's our chance!
Catch the Orion

He gave marvelous trick on the air
Let's give him a big big hand
I lost my position when I've been kicked in the face
Please give me a big big hand
The snowboard season has come!
Here's our chance!
Catch the Orion

Go Dark Cherries, move on
We got pride and friendship Move your body
Go Dark Cherries, move on
Over the sky-high mountain we got fighting spirits

Sometimes pray to God for help
Everybody wanna get the glory
Sometimes smoke a cigar on the summit
Everybody wanna get the glory
The snowboard season has come!
Here's our chance!
Catch the Orion

I wish I were a bird, we wish we were birds

Yo I wanna destroy
I'm a saint slave in a maze
Joy and Pain My heart easy to break
Got a dark face Art for Art's sake
Live STEALTH My dayz without a trace
I destroy But I was born to create
Ball and Chain My soul's lost it's place
Got a dark face Art for Art's sake
I never can explain my fuckin' wayz
Somethin' changes I think it again But down
Down and down But back on my feet again
Funny tragic comic callin' my name again
Callin' ones They really mean it
I got thing
Fixed dynamics Wishful panic
I mean I meant this ain't a game in strength
Sunny black in sonic Callin' my name again
Chosen ones really need it
I got thing

I GOT THING
I GOT THING WHEN I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT

Givin' back tha same amount given
Interaction through bipolar livin'
Livin' in purple Inner circle
Why you attracted to lost chaos? Livin'
I never do this just to please ya
Tha world causes me a seizure just for your leisure
Preacher That's tha sort of symbolic disappearer
Catch a cold blooded fever
This trigger-happy scene
Nothin' in-between
I thought you saw a star blink
Sympathizers believin' in
If I could give you anythin'
I would give you fixed statics is difficult to understand
Given strings to pull and play withstand
Full of monotonous choices a colorful blend
Cut off all distorted sounds
Live STEALTH
Just once and never again

I GOT THING
I GOT THING WHEN I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT

Somethin' changes I think it again But down
Down and down But back on my feet again
Funny tragic comic callin' my name again
Callin' ones They really mean it
I got thing
Fixed dynamics Wishful panic
I mean I meant this ain't a game in strength
Sunny black in sonic callin' my name again
Chosen ones really need it
I got thing
Everyone changes I think it again
Tha values I would kill for in this modest scene
Beautiful sick laughter out on tha beat again
Fallin' ones They really mean it
I got thing
Everythin' changes I think it again and again
Tha values I would live for in this freak scene
Similiar here after doubtin' foe and friend
Rollin' ones really need it
I got thing

I GOT THING
I GOT THING WHEN I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT

I've never dreamed before
I'm gonna knock the door
Into the world of perfect free
（You ain't no lonely!）

You're gonna say I'm lying
I'm gonna get the chance
I thought a chance is far from me
（You ain't no lonely!）

I was made to hit in America

I've never dreamed before
I'm gonna knock the door
Into the world of perfect free
（You ain't no lonely!）

You're gonna say I'm fool
But now I made it true
How many times I try to be
（You ain't no lonely!）

I was made to hit in America

You are the sun
You are the star
（To me, forever）

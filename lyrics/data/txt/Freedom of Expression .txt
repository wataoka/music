Rock'n'Roll it was my adolescence
Born on a fuckin' country
Hip Hop music it's my everything
to me it's like a hymn

When I suffer in mind, I'll keep on singin' maybe
'cause I don't wanna lose Freedom of Expression

When I fall in love, I'll keep on writtin' songs
'cause I don't wanna stiff emotion

I'm loser so fuckin' what?
I'm smoker so fuckin' what?
I'm Japanese so fuckin' what?
I'm winner so fuckin' what?

I'm pinhead you right
But I don't wanna hide-face life
Give me some more time
for thinkin' bout love and the music
Stand up people
Say something

Turn the radio up
君の夢に似合う freedom
君の freedom
What makes you feel so blue?
Oh, 救えない明日はないさ get up and find it
Beautiful days
風の emotion 愛嬌の shape
Let it grow, let it blow now
Turn the radio up
そう繰り出そうか brand-new-day
想い出は escape

Love is dreaming
Love is feeling
Love is breathing
Love is believing

Everybody, say now!
Everybody, say now!

A-ha! All we really want
All we really want
All we really need is love
A-ha! All we really want
All we really need is
Love, love, love

今 それがなきゃ震えてる daylight

Aha!

Here we go now
Rollin' 風だけが恋を告げる blue grass style
Inside out
Your outside is in
君の消えない wish 失くして afraid
Baby, mind your step, now

Hey, do you feel like a movie star
Hey, do you feel like a rock'n'roll star
Turn the radio up
君のslow でsweetな唄が
明日を変える sounds like Bob Allen Dylan

Love is dreaming
Love is feeling
Love is breathing
Love is believing

Everybody, say now!
Everybody, say now!

A-ha! All we really want
All we really want
All we really need is love
A-ha! All we really want
All we really need is
Love, love, love

A-ha! Hey, you really know
Hey, you really know
Hey, you really know 'bout it
A-ha! All you really want
All you really need is
Love, love, love

日々がそれでなきゃ終わらん days
泣けどぬぐえない just a little way, now
まためくるめく night and day
A little way now
A little way now

Everybody, say now
Everybody, say now
Everybody, say now
Everybody, say now
Everybody, say now

A-ha! All we really want
All we really want
All we really need is love
A-ha! All we really want
All we really need is
Love, love, love

A-ha! Hey, you really know
Hey, you really know
Hey, you really know 'bout it
A-ha! All you really want
All you really need is
Love, love, love

A-ha! A-ha!
A-ha! All we really want
Is love, love
All we really need is love

A-ha! All we really need is love
A-ha! All we really need is love
A-ha! All we really need is love

A-ha! All we really want
All we really need is love

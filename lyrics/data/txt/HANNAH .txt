Now that I have sold out
There is not much I can do
Kiss people's ass and hopefully
They'll all come to love me one day

They all sound the same
Can you feel my pain?

If you want to be successful here
All you have to do is sing about love
And they'll love you
'Cause that's all they want to hear

You don't have to mean it
They don't really care
So here's another phrase:

探し続けていたものはここにある
理屈や理由などをつける必要はなく
胸に宿りし花がここにて咲く
Come on, come on, come on

You better be careful what you say here
Boy, watch your mouth

I know for one thing they'll get pissed and
Bash the hell out of me via internet

You don't have to mean it
To be loved or hated
So here's another phrase:

探し続けていたものはここにある
理屈や理由などをつける必要はなく
胸に宿りし花がここにて咲く
Come on, come on, come on

People react too seriously
To the things I think are a waste of time

I say direct your attention
To the things that matter

探し続けていたものはここにある
理屈や理由などをつける必要はなく
胸に宿りし花がここにて咲く
Come on, come on, come on

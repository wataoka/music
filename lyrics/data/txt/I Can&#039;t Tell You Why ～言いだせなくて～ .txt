Look at us, baby, up all night
Tearin' our love apart
Aren't we the same two people
who lived through years in the dark
Ahh...

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

When we get crazy,
it just ain't right,
(Try to keep you head, little baby)
Baby, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you

Nothin's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

No, no, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

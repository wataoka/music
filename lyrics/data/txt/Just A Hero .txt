はしゃぎすぎた夜 消えいれば ブルージー MORNING
霧の様なRAIN しめつけるだけ
温りさえも 忘れかけた夜なら
何も言わずに瞳を閉じるだけ
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
すり抜けてゆく 悲しみのBOYS & GIRLS
笑えずに さまよい歩くだけ

(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
だから このまま
(You Just a Hero) I (Just a Hero) 泣かないで BABY
You (Just a Hero) I (Just a Hero) 抱きしめて DARLING
傾きかけた 夢のかけら

(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
(I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR)
だから このまま
(You Just a Hero) I (Just a Hero) 泣かないで BABY
You (Just a Hero) I (Just a Hero) 抱きしめて DARLING
You (Just a Hero) I (Just a Hero) 泣かないで BABY
You (Just a Hero) I (Just a Hero) 抱きしめて DARLING
傾きかけた 夢のかけら

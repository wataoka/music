Laughing,Stranding,Standing,
'Cos our life is just a trampoline
Got no sunshine rise on a despair

Laughing,Stranding,standing,
'Cos our life is like a submarine
Even sunshine reach into deep ends

Got to see
Got to feel inside I'm all alone
And standing in the storm

Day after day
The ghost's watching you
Day after day
Souls that you lose
Day after day
The ghost's watching you
Day after day

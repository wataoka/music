二人の恋は 迷路のようさ
答えなんてない 「さよなら」はまだ早い
見上げればほら 果てしない空
同じ痛みを 分けあえる喜びと 歩き出そう

You can't tell me
愛は眠らない それは未来
And you can't tell me
終わることなどない 広い世界
You try to believe and make me agree
Love don't matter at all, but it still matters to me

Said you need time alone,
thought you'd be better off on your own
But when I hear your voice you don't give me any choice
you pull me back in
一人じゃない 傷つけあい 離れていても
心でずっと 扉が待ってるよ もう一度

You can't tell me
愛は眠らない それは未来
And you can't tell me
終わることなどない 広い世界
You try to believe and make me agree
Love don't matter at all, but it still matters to me

I know you don't want to leave it all behind and you can't deny
This love matters more than anything tonight

You can't deny (見つめあう)
what's in your eyes (瞳は)
If we just try to make it right (二人なら)
Just let love heal (愛しい)
All that matters you and me (この想い)

You can't tell me
愛は眠らない それは未来
(ここから未来が始まる)
And you can't tell me
終わることなどない 広い世界
(新しい世界が生まれたんだ)
You try to believe and make me agree
Love don't matter at all, but it still matters to me

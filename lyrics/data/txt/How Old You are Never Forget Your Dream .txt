Sunny day
The birds sing
Beautiful but painful
Tune fondly reminds me of all the old days

My own dream fell from my hands as I have got older
Why?
Guess it's how I've become
Not a child

Little boy questioned his mother,
he asked what he can be in the future
With a sad smile, she tells him he can be anything he wants to be

Stuck in between social expectation
We lie and hide what's so called“dream”
We learn how to obey other people
We change so that we don't be outcasts

Boy said he'd become (an) astronaut and fly out into space
Crews around the universe
He wanted to see the stars and also see other planets in outer space

Why don't we just keep dreaming
Let's keep our mind with dream and faith
As long as we wish we can make it come true
How old you are never forget your dream
Keep dreaming
Let's keep our mind with dream and faith
It may take long but have trust
Try your best
Don't wait for dreams to come true
Attain it by yourself

It wont matter
You make (the) difference

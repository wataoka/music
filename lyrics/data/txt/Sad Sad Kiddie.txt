I know you
You get on my nerves
You feel that way too.
It's the same with me

You don't see me
too late for regrets
I can't permit you
to stain my pride

Will you leave behind the lost words?
Just a few steps to tell
There's no use saying anything
Hey, you!
sad sad kiddie, so long

I know you
You are not my type
If I were you, I want to hide
It's so to speak, a grown-up baby
You are selfish, an idle fish

Will you leave behind the lost words?
Just a few steps to tell
There's no use saying anything
Hey, you!
sad sad kiddie, so long

Will you leave behind the lost words?
Just a few steps to tell
There's no use saying anything
Hey, you!
Nobody comes to help you for ever
sad sad kiddie, so long

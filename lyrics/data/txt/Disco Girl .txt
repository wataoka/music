Now five. Will she ever go to sleep?
In a zone, she gets down
All alone, but she can hold her own.

By far, she's a head above it all
But she'll never take a chance
'cause you know she won't let me down.

No soul(but)you can never have it all
She can hustle on the fly
She's a pro, she can handle it.

Stay still, then you check out the groove
Baby's smooth, oh yeah, now I bet you that you wanna move.

Down low, shake a tooch, she can fish
She can make her bones bend, freakin' out, Barry Manilo.

You'll see, she can take ya downtown
Mow the lawn, pass a dish, sprinkle down like a jigolo

DJ, spinnin' loud, bust a move
Can ya dig it 'till dawn?
Boogie dancin' on it on and on
Hot beat, yeah ya whip it all down
You gotta"bus stop"with the flow.

No count but I pump my beat
Heads down, watch me move my feet, yo!
It's my town, show you where you're from
It's my crown, when the switch is on, you know!

Boycott, 'n you'll never know
How far I can make you go so low
I stand even when I fall
I never never never never never never never give up.

No time 'cause she's keepin' on the run
Nothin' fun, It's a job
'cause she just won't put it down

Too late, never made it to the show
Take a blow, all aloneâ€¦ you know what?
She can't handle it.

Down low, shake a tooch, she can fish
She can make her bones bend, freakin' out, Barry Manilo.

You'll see, she can take ya downtown
Mow the lawn, pass a dish, sprinkle down like a jigolo

DJ, spinnin' loud, bust a move
Can ya dig it 'till dawn?
Boogie dancin'on it on and on
Hot beat, yeah ya whip it all down
You gotta"bus stop"with the flow.

No count but I pump my beat
Heads down, watch me move my feet, yo!
It's my town, show you where you're from
It's my crown, when the switch is on, you know!

Boycott, 'n you'll never know
How far I can make you go so low
I stand even when I fall
I never never never never never never never give up.

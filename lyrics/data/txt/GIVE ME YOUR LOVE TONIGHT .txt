It's gettin' late now
I'm wide awake now
A lover's moon on the rise
I'm feelin' restless
A little breathless
Will you be comin' tonight?
In the dark I listen
Every moment wishin'
I'll hear you knockin' at my door

Back in the alley
Stray cats are howlin'
A serenade to the night
Wind's turnin' colder
Startin' to wonder
Am I just wastin' my time?
Darlin', how I worry
Baby, won't you hurry
I need you near me
I need your sweet talk to cheer me

Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me
Tell me you still feel the same
You know your woman
Needs reassuring
Tell me you love me again

Love is what I've prayed for
Give me your love, all of youe love
Love is what I'm made for
Give me your love, all of your love
Tonight
Give me your love tonight

On every corner
The same old story
Somebody's tellin' a lie
Somebody's laughin'
Somebody's cryin'
Somebody's lonely tonight
Must you keep me waiting
When my heart is breaking
I need you near me
I need your sweet talk to cheer me

Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me
Tell me you still feel the same
You know your woman
Needs reassuring
Tell me you love me again

Love is what I've prayed for
Give me your love, all of youe love
Love is what I'm made for
Give me your love, all of your love
Tonight
Give me your love tonight

Give me your love tonight
Give me your love tonight

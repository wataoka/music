What was it she did to break your heart 
Betray your heart and everything 
Kiss you with a kiss that wasn't true 
It wasn't you at all 
Hide behind a painted smile, did you know that 
You would live a lie or two 
Pull the very ground from under you 
And leave you nowhere else to run 

You can sail the seven seas and find 
Love is a place you'll never see 
Passing you like a summer breeze 
You feel life has no other reason to be 
You can wait a million years and find 
That heaven's too far away from you 
Love's just a thing others do 
What is love 
Till it comes home to you 

Did she promise you the world and did that 
Girl just throw your love away 
Leave you like a lonely solitare 
With just despair for company 
Do you think you'd find revenge so sweet 
Make it so you hearts will never beat 
Squeeze the very last and dying breath from 
Everything you've ever dreamed 

You can sail the seven seas and find 
Love is a place you'll never see 
Passing you like a summer breeze 
You feel life has no other reason to be 
You can wait a million years and find 
That heaven's too far away from you 
Love's just a thing others do 
What is love 
Till it comes home to you

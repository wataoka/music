When I just can't find my way 
You are always there for me 
When I am out of my way 
You are always there for me 

When I just can't find my way 
You are always there for me 
When I am out of my way 
You are always there for me 

Like a bird in the sky 
You set me free 
You give me one heart 
Like a star in my night 
You'll always be a part of me 

When I just can't find my way 
You are always there 
You are always there 
You are always there for me 

In my darkness dreams 
I hear you call me 
You give me the reason to live 
In my dirty heart 
I hear you call me 
And you reach out to carry me away 

No one can save my soul 
Only you 

Like a bird in the sky 
You set me free 
You give me one heart 
Like a star in my night 
You'll always be a part of me 

暗い月 暗示する 
その光の先では 
不確かな 存在の 
僕の夢が 生まれ変わる 

急ぎ 生きるけど 
ごめんね 

鳥が空を 飛び回れるように 
僕は自由に今なれるんだ 

僕は自由に今なれるんだ 

鳥が空を 飛び回れるように 
僕は自由に今なれるんだ 

Like a bird in the sky 
You set me free 
You give me one heart 
Like a star in my night 
You'll always be a part of me

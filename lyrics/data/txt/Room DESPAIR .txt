I hear you grieving
All through the night
Welcome to my world
The Room DESPAIR

Won't let you turn back
Won't let you get out
When you think it over
It's already too late

Make up your mind

I'll give you what you want
With a blink of my eye
I'll give you what you want
It's easy as can be
But
Don't you know?
You never get
What you really want

This final notice
Turns off the lights
What's the point in shining?
It shows you things that hurt you

I'm telling you

I'll give you what you want
I'll even give you love
I'll give you what you want
It's easy as can be

But at the end of the night

The more you take
The more you lose

You better know

One day sitting in a tree
I couldn't help but notice you there in the park.
You weren't like all the others
you could fit me in your pocket
and seemed rather large.

But then you really tried to talk to me
we chatted all about your mom and everything
and if somebody pointed out the fact you have no wings...
wouldn't mean a thing.

Didn't try to put me in a cage of your convenience
as some others have.
Instead you took me to your favorite garden in Manhattan
and we had a laugh.

Along the way I fell in love with you
you know that I could never get enough of you
and if somebody pointed out the fact that you can't sing...
wouldn't mean a thing.

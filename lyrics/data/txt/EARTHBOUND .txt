YOU TOOK ME HIGHER
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN
NOW THAT WE'RE STRANGERS
I'VE COME DOWN AGAIN

BACK TO THE REAL EORLD
BACK TO THE REAL EORLD
BACK TO THE GROUND
NOT HIGH ABOVE IT
WITHOUT YOUR LOVING
NOW I'M EARTHBOUND

BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IT LIFTED ME ABOVE IT ALL
WITHOUT IT, IT'S LEAVING ME SO FAR TO FALL
I HOPE YOU FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
I NEVER THOUGHT THERE COULD BE ANYMORE

BUT IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO
YOU TAKE THE HIGH I'LL TAKE THE LOW
BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE ME DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU LEAVE ME EARTHBOUND

YOU TOOK ME HIGHER
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN
NOW THAT WE'RE STRANGERS
I'VE COME DOWN AGAIN

BACK TO THE REAL WORLD
BACK TO THE REAL WORLD
BACK TO THE GROUND
NOT HIGH ABOVE IT
UP WHERE THE LOVE IS
NOW I'M EARTHBOUND

BECAUSE WE USED TO SAY
THAT WE WERE FAR AWAY
BECAUSE OUR LOVE IT TOOK US
TO ANOTHER PLACE
AND IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO FACE

BUT IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO
YOU TAKE THE HIGH I'LL TAKE THE LOW
BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE ME DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU LEAVE ME EARTHBOUND

EARTHBOUND

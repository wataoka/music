I'VE GOT A FEELING OF A DEEP SENSE OF ISOLATION.
I WONDER WHO CAN UNDERSTAND AND THEY REALLY GOT THE MEANING.
I'VE GOT A FEELING OF A DEEP SENSE OF ISOLATION.
I WONDER WHAT CAN I UNDERSTAND.
THE SIGHT AHEAD, CLOSING MY EYES.

I'M GOING AHEAD THROUGH THE ROAD MOMENT BY MONENT.
I SAW THE PLACE THAT LEFT WHEN I FEEL DOWN AGAIN.
IT GOES ROUND AND ROUND CIRCLES WITHOUT ANY CHANGES.

BED SPACE REQUIEM FOR WHAT REASON.
BED SPACE REQUIEM, GO ON WONDERING ABOUT.

I'VE GOT FEELING OF A DEEP SENSE OF ISOLATION.
I'VE GOT FEELING OF A DEEP SENSE OF ISOLATION.
I WONDER WHO CAN UNDERSTAND AND THE PERSON REALLY GOT IT.
I WONDER WHAT CAN I UNDERSTAND.
THE SIGHT AHEAD... CLOSING MY EYES...

BED SPACE REQUIEM FOR WHAT REASON.
BED SPACE REQUIEM, GO ON WONDERING ABOUT.

(対訳)
BED SPACE REQIEM

一人置き去りにされた気持ち
誰に何が解るのか 意味は解るのか
一人置き去りにされた気持ち
私に何が解るのか 本当に何が解るのか
消え入る…予覚

刻々とただ刻々と行く
気付くとまた私の転んだ跡が見える
いつまでも続く堂々回り…

BED SPACE REQUIEM
何のために…
BED SPACE REQUIEM
さ迷い続けるのか…

White is the color of my one true love
Like flower pedals so lovely
Just like the lillies that I've always loved
Oh such sweet memories

He was the one that I always would love
My love from a place oh so dear to me
White lillies bloom at his feet
White is the color of my one true love
Memories oh so sweet

Blue is the color of the clear, pure sky
Oh so beautiful forever more
Blue is the color of my very first love
True love evermore

He was the one that I always would love
My love from a place oh so dear to me
His shoulder right beside mine
Blue was the color of that clear, pure sky
Oh that first love of mine

Red is the color of the setting sun
Memories in my mind
Tears in my eyes blurring my sight
Memories oh so bright

He was the one that I always would love
My love from a place oh so dear to me
Tears filled up his eyes
Red is the color of the setting sun
Memories oh so bright

Babe babe…
Where do you go to?
With such a haggard face
[I want to escape from this pain…]
-live or die-
Answer is bullshit
Half-killing a snake

That screech
What do you want to convey?
acatalepsy

Under the red sun
I ask you it once again
[I came to look for heaven such as the hell…]
I had a bad dream
Very cruel beautifully

Answer is bullshit
Half-killing a snake

That screech

acatalepsy

A hallucination takes you
To the eden where nobody is...
The fake fear left you
The girl who plays with a white rope
Marionette on the gallows

Dance until you die
Waltz of the fatal dose
Like a gabriel
堕落してゆく
羽がもげた君
Gallows...Under the blue sky
You need it
Gallows...Under the blue sky
You grieve
Gallows...Under the blue sky
You cannot die

To the eden where nobody is...
The fake fear left you
The girl who plays with a white rope
Marionette on the gallows

Dance until you die
Waltz of the fatal dose
Like a gabriel
堕落してゆく
笑みを零し

Dance until you die
Waltz of the fatal dose
Like a gabriel
堕落してゆく
羽がもげた君
Gallows...Under the blue sky
You need it
Gallows...Under the blue sky
You grieve
Gallows...Under the blue sky
You cannot die

永久に美しく

Leave You
Yes, I'll leave you once again
Like so many times I've tried before
But this time will be the last time
Don't make it harder now for me to go

Love you, oh you know I really do
But all you do is sit and cry
When love brings only sorrow
Then it's better to say Good-bye

＊Our love was like a song
　A love song without an ending
　Why have we stopped singing now
　Only the melody plays on

＊＊Believe me when I say I really care
　　I'll reach out for you when I'm alone
　　But I pray we'll have the courage
　　To find happiness on our own
（＊Repeat）

（＊＊Repeat）
To find happiness on our own

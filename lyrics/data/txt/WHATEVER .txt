Oh Oh Oh... whatever, whatever, whatever you say!
Whatever you say! Whatever you say!

Washing, drying, folding and over and over again
But if I quit all of the sudden so who's gonna do it?
I never ever make it on time and deadline, no way!
I've got something else to do that's more important to me
Yeah

I guess you know I am an actress
Inside my heart I'm always waiting for you

Oh Oh Oh... whatever, whatever, whatever you say!
Whatever you say! Whatever you say!

Yes-yes, no-no, uh-huh and what's gonna come up next?
You are so boring I don't feel like talking to you
The other day he yelled at me and I got a headache
He better learn how to tell cuz all I remember is his angry face
His stupid face

I don't think it's so complicated
Don't you dare to apply pressure to my way!

Oh Oh Oh... whatever, whatever, whatever you say!
Oh Oh… whatever you say!
Oh… whatever, whatever, whatever you say!

I only want to see the beauty side of it all
I only want to join when I feel so much fun
I only want to cry when I could feel so happy
No need to listen!
No need, baby, whatever you want!

Look up. Have you seen this sky?
Stand up. Do you feel this wind?
You never need to hurry up baby
And listen, whatever, whatever I say!!

If you were walking to my door
Or if you were running to my door
There is gonna be a happy time anyway
So, whatever, whatever, whatever they say!

Oh Oh Oh... whatever you say!
Oh Oh Oh... whatever, whatever, whatever you say!

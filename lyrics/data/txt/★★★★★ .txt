His voice no longer reaches out to anyone
It can only be heard from the speaker from the speaker
We've only met once, and you wewere so great
You treated us as your brothers
Treated us as your brothers

Where did you go?
Without saying a word
His tears sparkle sadly like the heavenly stars above

I have lost my words
I can not speak take away
The darkness of my heart
Take it away Heard that happiness is coming to his lovely wife
It must be a gift from the heaven for her to live

Where did you go?
Without saying a word
His tears sparkle sadly like the heavenly stars above

Let's live strong!
It's for him
The bright future is waiting for us
We'll never forget
It's a message from the brother to us
I have lost my words
I can not speak take away
The darkness of my heart
Take it away

Let's live strong!
It's for him
The bright future is waiting for us
We'll never forget
It's a message from the brother to us
I have lost my words
I can not speak take away
The darkness of my heart
Take it away

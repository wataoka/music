Traveling in time
The outer space swallowing your mind
I know you can hear me now
Wondering if I realy exist

Runnin' out of lies and self-deceit
Realisation dawning
Bittersweet horizon
Fly away

Breaking the lie

There's a million ways to hush my voice
And a million knives to kill my thoughts
Maybe I'm all that you fear
I'm a stargazer
My eyes see differently....

Alien transmission through my brain
Bright shadows' ghostly traces in the sky now
You're as weird as you think I am

Runnin' out of lies and self-deceit
Realisation dawning
Bittersweet horizon
Fly away

Breaking the fear

There's a million ways to hush my voice
And a million knives to kill my thoughts
Maybe I'm all that you fear
I'm a stargazer
I want to believe....

Controlling lives
From a tv screen
Condemning lives
Playing god
Annihilation
Is the only salvation...?

Maybe I'm a thorn in your perfection
A heretic's voice in your head
A stargazer, releaser...

There's a million ways to hush my voice
And a million knives to kill my thoughts
Maybe I'm all that you fear
I'm a stargazer
My eyes see differently....

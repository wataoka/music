That dear small bus
ran through a coastline.
I went to your room
with an old gut guitar.

We met rock'n'roll
at the country town.
And the body temperature
rose each other.

That racing days
brought me up.
That's your favor and
kindness from my town.
I wanted to sneak so much.

Poster of the star.
Idol on the wall.
We copied the hairstyle,
but it was corny.

Midnight radio show
That's our textbook.
We knew the meaning
of the life with that.

That racing days
brought me up.
That's your favor and
kindness from my town.
I wanted to sneak so much.

We didn't meet any more,
but we're a friend.
I still like you.
Maybe, now.
That racing days
brought me up.
That's your favor and
kindness from my town.
I wanted to sneak so much.

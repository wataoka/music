What you gonna do when I come for you
What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do when I come for you
What you gonna do what you gonna do

So what's the time? 止まりはしない
注目の的を追って 飽きたら捨てて
時計の針が指した“今”は一秒後に昔話のよう
Come and go,round and round
そんな移り気な価値判断じゃなくYou better check me out
The speed star who is reaching you
誰よりも早く君を迎えに
I will keep running and fight

And Go for it Go for it I can be the one so Go for it
Go for it Go for it I can be the one now Go for it
君の待つ場所へ
Just Go for it Go for it I can be the one now Go for it

What you gonna do when I comes for you
What you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do when I comes for you
What you gonna do what you gonna do

胸が刻むHeartbeat
描き出したBlue print
それが教えてくれる Just do it right now
迷う暇も与えない
次の音を奏でた時には既にI'm gone
Haters Fellows Looking at me!
I'm speed star who is reaching you
この先どこまででも構わない
I will keep running and fight

And Go for it Go for it I can be the one so Go for it
Go for it Go for it I can be the one now Go for it
君の待つ場所へ
just Go for it Go for it I can be the one now Go for it

Uh Yeah Ah I'll be the one
Uh Yeah Ah I'll be the one

When we meet up
君は笑ってくれる?
Cause I made it all for you
Until next time I'll try my best
再会の時は何処にしよう?

What you gonna do when I comes for you
What you gonna do What you gonna do

What you gonna do when I comes for you
What you gonna do What you gonna do

Go for it Go for it I can be the one so Go for it
Go for it Go for it I can be the one now Go for it
君の待つ場所へ
just Go for it Go for it I can be the one now Go for it

Uh yeah Ah I'll be the one
Uh yeah Ah I'll be the one

Everyday I listen to my heart
In times when I can't see
When my faith is nowhere to be found
I trust the voice in me

So when you're lost wishing for an angel
Or a hand to pull you through
When the world is on your shoulder
Just trust the voice in you

Everyday I listen to my heart
When I'm too numb to feel
When my strength is nowhere to be found
I trust the voice in …
Me, in me

Sometimes life moves in mysterious ways
And you don't know where it will end
It's a fight, no one can fill your place
And nothin's like you planned

But when you call looking for an answer
To justify what you have to do
Baby don't look any further
Just trust the voice in you

Everyday I listen to my heart
When I'm just too blind to see
When my faith is nowhere to be found
I trust the voice in me

When the world is on your shoulder
And you're looking for your way

Everyday I listen to my heart
When I'm too numb to feel
When my strength is nowhere to be found
I trust the voice in me

We all have our own private war
You know those times when doubt fills your head
When all good advice will only get you misled

Everyday I listen to my heart
In times when I can't see
When my faith is nowhere to be found
I trust the voice in me

Everyday I listen to my heart
When I'm too numb to feel
When my strength is nowhere to be found
I trust the voice in …
Me, in me

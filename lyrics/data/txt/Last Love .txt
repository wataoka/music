I just felt that I knew it all
I just tried to put it all away
Everytime I got too much to recall
I'm holding back my tears

Taking plenty of time
We all made it getting here
And we wanted someone to understand
What we believe

Fireworks in water
That's how I'm burning as a fighter
No matter what will wait for us
Please let me get closer
And let me touch the core of your world
As we are carrying on
Till all pain's gone

No one knows who is who at all
Someone calls someone to fall apart
Everything I did wrong for our love was
That we had no fears

My world is going around
I can touch the ground
And I'll be the core of my world
For holding your hand

Fireworks in water
That's how I'm burning as a fighter
No matter what will wait for us
Please let me get closer
And let me touch the core of your world
As we are carrying on
Till all pain's gone

Trying to talk about things that are trivial
Is making my heart beating like a merry-go-around
I had some nights that I shed tears on my pillow
Believing in myself everything will be alright
All I wanna do is to walk by your side

Fireworks in water
That's how I'm burning as a fighter
No matter what will wait for us
Please let me get closer
And let me touch the core of your world
As we are carrying on
Till our love never goes away

Where am I?
Who am I?
Who are you?
Are you my friend?
Are you my Teddy Bear?

I'm not your PERFECT you
I'm not your WISH come true
I'm not your CUPCAKE feeling
I'm not your LOLLIPOP healing
I'm not your FAIRY LULLABY
I'm not your ONCE UPON A TIME
I'm not always so FRIENDLY
But I'm not always your ENEMY
(You can always try me)

Who am I?
Be careful
Who am I?

I'M YOUR DEVIL

Hello and welcome to my tea party
Please mind your step as you come to join me
Don't close your eyes,
you might meet the Candy Killer
Don't fall asleep, she will take your heart forever

Let's leave behind sunny sugar daydream
It's time to try gothic melting Ice cream
The table's set, tea is served in royal darkness
You take a sip, become the Midnight cat's eyes Princess

Leave behind everything
What you need I will bring and
Is this real or a dream
Will they hear if you scream and
Let me trick or treat you into thinking you are safe and
If you don't like where I've taken you then
You can turn
Round and go
RIGHT BACK TO YOUR BED ROOM

I'm gonna make your heaven
Tell me your wish in your hell
罪深き深淵に見た月
私に触れて硝子の中に
悲しみを映し出してDolly Eyes

Hello... My dear†
Can you hear my voice?
心に闇を広げて
Let's make a wish !
真っ暗な瞳に何が見えたの?

Can't hide the scars, they cut too deep now
And you know just what they mean
Don't want to live and don't want to die now
You are stuck here in between
Do you kill yourself, return yourself now
To the devil in your dream?
Your darkest wishes all come true now
Via pain that can't be seen

目を逸らさないでここにいるわ
Baby I'm here
鏡の世界で逢える
You can see my face
I'M YOUR DEVIL
I live inside your mind

Yes, my princess
Your DEVIL is here
解いたら苦しくなる
記憶の結び目に傷をつけ消してあげる

Be very careful what you wish now,
and be all that you can be
I am your devil woken up now,
and I'm here to set you free
Inside you hear two voices scream now,
that is you and that is me
Just think of me as part of you now,
I'm your inner “Heavenly”

零れたインクでここに誓えるのなら
Show me your dream
叶えてあげるその悪夢を
I'M YOUR DEVIL
I live inside your mind

Can't hide the scars, they cut too deep now
And you know just what they mean
Don't want to live and don't want to die now
You are stuck here in between
Do you kill yourself, return yourself now
To the devil in your dream?
Your darkest wishes all come true now
Via pain that can't be seen

Be very careful what you wish now,
and be all that you can be
I am your devil woken up now,
and I'm here to set you free
Inside you hear two voices scream now,

Just think of me as part of you now,
I'm your inner “Heavenly”

Can you hear my voice?
Your DEVIL is here

I'm gonna make your heaven
Tell me your wish in your hell
後悔をミルク色に染めて
陶器のように滑らかな手で
そのハート私に差し出して

Be very careful what you wish now,
and be all that you can be
I am your devil woken up now,
and I'm here to set you free
Inside you hear two voices scream now,
that is you and that is me
Just think of me as part of you now,
I'm your inner “Heavenly”

You can call me heavenly6

目を逸らさないで
ここにいるわBaby I'm here
鏡を覗いて私を選んでMy Dear
深紅のインクで闇に誓えるのなら
Show me your dream
叶えてあげるその悪夢を
I'M YOUR DEVIL
I live inside your mind

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ”Son can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes,
but it's sad and it sweet and I knew it
complete when I were a younger man's clothes.”

la la didi daa
la la didi daa
daa dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
We're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drink for free
and he's quick with a joke
or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, ”Bill, I believe this is killing me,”
as the smile ran away from his face
”well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
if could get out of this place.”

la la didi daa

Now paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davey who's still in the Navy
and probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
as the businessman slowly get stoned
Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinking alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
We're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for awhile

And the piano sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ”Man, what are you doing here?”

la la didi daa
la la didi daa
daa dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
We're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

I'm thinking of you
I still can hear you
It's hard to believe
You're far away

I'm here alone now
Look above the sky
I hope that you see
The same star

We've gotta be strong
We've gotta find
A way out of this
Dark side

Wherever you are
I'm right by your side
So don't ever stop
Believing

I needed a second to realize the matter of gravity we were trapped in,
wanna rewind the face of time wishing that none of this ever happened...
Fukai Zetsubokan... can you imagine?
Kessite Wasurenai, I keep on asking, why!?
Demo, got to be strong, to carry on,
Egao Modoru Made Susumu, until that day
we will move on, unbreakable bond,
you know our spirit can't be washed away!!

You may be far away
But baby you're my lifeline
No matter how dark the day
Your presence is a bright light

You give me hope
You give me strength
I'll carry on into the twilight

Yeah I was lost
But now I'm found
I'm not alone you're in my heart now

la, la, la, la, la..... 「T.H.A.N.K.Y.O.U.」

You may be far away
But baby you're my lifeline
No matter how dark the day
Your presence is a bright light

You give me hope
You give me strength
I'll carry on into the twilight

Yeah I was lost
But now I'm found
I'm not alone you're in my heart now

You may be far away
But baby you're my lifeline
No matter how dark the day
Your presence is a bright light

You give me hope
You give me strength
I'll carry on into the twilight

Yeah I was lost
But now I'm found
I'm not alone you're in my heart now

Locked and loaded, ready to go
If you take us on then under you go
The plan is simple
We fight to win
Try to take our freedom
Let the battle begin

See the world's been broken
We've lost too much already
Time is still ticking
People need to be ready
Take back what they took from you
Search for the truth
Break the limits they place on you
Never give up on your friends
Show 'em how you do
We'll get 'em all free
It's time to get freed

(Hit 'em)
Since we can't go back
We gotta move forward
Learn how to do that to see where we're going
My friends by my side we'll stand
Even when you close in

'Cause you know can't keep us down
We won't give in
You can't keep us down
We won't stand for what you're doin'
You can't keep us down
We won't give in
You can't keep us down
We won't give in
We can't go back
We gotta move forward
Learn how to do that to see where we're going
Because, you see
My friends by my side we will stand
Even when you close in
You can't keep us down
We won't give in
You can't keep us down
We won't stand for what you're doin'

Locked and loaded, ready to go
If you take us on then under you go
The plan is simple
We fight to win
Try to take our freedom
Let the battle begin

Fact or fiction
Truth is that the surprise attack made us all
victims
We lost many but still carry on living strong
Though you did your best to take our freedom
We want it back for good
We don't believe that you came to help with a
cure
More like
Turn us on each other to insure your own word
as bond
But our only response is rebellion
Push your propaganda if you must
Steal the government we don't trust
Tell the world you came to save us?
Take your time
We're armoring up
We can't get back all we've lost
But we'll recover what we can
The fight we bring is to set things right
Doesn't matter what you try
We will stand

'Cause you know can't keep us down
We won't give in
You can't keep us down
We won't stand for what you're doin'
You can't keep us down
We won't give in
You can't keep us down
We won't give in
We can't go back
We gotta move forward
Learn how to do that to see where we're going
Because, you see
My friends by my side we will stand
Even when you close in
You can't keep us down
We won't give in
You can't keep us down
We won't stand for what you're doin'

This is My Guilty Crown
I'll fight for what I believe
This is My Guilty Crown
I'll fight with my friends to set my friends free

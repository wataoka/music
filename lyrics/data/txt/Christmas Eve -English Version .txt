All alone I watch the quiet rain
Wonder if it's gonna snow again
Silent night, Holy night

I was praying
you'd be here with me
But Chrisymas Eve ain't
what it used to be
Silent night, Holy night

If you were beside me
Then I could hear angels
And I'd give you rainbows,
for Christmas

Somewhere far away
the sleighbells ring
I remember
when we used to sing
Silent night, Holy night

I keep you inside me
Oh the truth is unspoken,
So my heart won't be broken,
on Christmas

They lit the trees
along the avenue
Twinkling silver with a touch of blue
Silent night, Holy night

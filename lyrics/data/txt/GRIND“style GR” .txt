You just don't care any more?

Who cares for the weed under that thrive
Let live or die
Just step on it if
you know

yeah

Everybody wants rush inside
That hunger to die
Take the honey
Eat the body, it's you

just a step away

your mind bleed on the hell you raised
roaring your fate

uurgh

shout out that question burning inside
where is the life
Where is the pride

shadowing the light

Just a step and you're away
down the gate of hell's doorway
Just an inch to your own way
this world's crazed out accelerlation

Oh yes, just forget everything
and eat up all the pleasure around
Don't fight it, relax. Let go of yourself
no need to worry, it's just that you'll perish in the end

Just a step and you're away
down the gate of hell's doorway
Just an inch to your own way
this world's crazed out acceleration

Grind!
Grind!
Grind!

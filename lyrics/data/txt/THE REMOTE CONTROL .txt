Funny game makes people fussy
Had a hardtime
(Killing the villain)
The bad guy came alive
Using a remote control
Life cannot be rewounded
Then I became a dead drunk
I got home there was a gallon of vanilla ice cream
It must be a fight against my will, I will try
Life cannot be rewounded, so life goes on
Then I became a dead drunk, so let's go!

It's not my day!
(Waiting to ease my soul)
Today's not my day!
Hot tempers are big
(Waiting to ease my soul)
losers, come on

It's not my day!
(Waiting to ease my soul)
Today's not my day!
It's not my day!
(Waiting to ease my soul)
But I want to welcome my friends!

Super beagle“Sid”isn't here anymore, so sad
He should be the one
To be rewounded by remote control

It's not my day!
(Waiting to ease my soul)
Today's not my day!
Hot tempers are big
(Waiting to ease my soul)
losers, come on

It's not my day!
(Waiting to ease my soul)
Today's not my day!
It's not my day!
(Waiting to ease my soul)
But I want to welcome my friends!

Twilight
Coming into my heart
A beautiful misty light
Sharing our love
Making me feel so right
You're bringing out the human in me

Silent
There is no one in sight
I only see you in my eyes
Feeling you close
Passion rising up high
Each momeht, yes I want you

※I love You
　For all my life, sharing cur dreams
　Together gonna make it through
　And if some tears, starts to fall
　I know, you're gonna dry them
　For me
　When I reach out my hand
　I find you there
　Gives me the strength to carry on, darling
　I need you, cause you are
　My precious love

Twilight
I find my treasure in you
My life became so clear so true
Gone is the past
Running for the future
I never felt this way before

Silent
Slowly time passes by
I see the dawn across the sky
Facing the world
Telling me come what may
Come with me, yes I need you

※Repeat

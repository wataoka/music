I was left in this room alone
Someone tell me what's going on
Baby, you have already left
I've kept lying to you & I'm crying for you everyday

Baby, you were my valentine
Bring me another glass of wine
I'll dye it blue with my tear
I keep getting drunk & waiting for you every night

NO NO that's terrible
I wish I could say no regret
Oh, No so it's pitiful
Please make it a little easier for me

So you so what you gonna do
Baby put a gun against me
Gotta go so get out of my head
Today will start better day for you

Baby, my responsibility?
Did I do quite a stupid thing?

Someone please tell me my mistake?
There is no light for me & I'm blind with tear everybody

I read the holy bible
Finally I lost my control
I'm dying in the darkness
No one can stop me & save me from this deep grief

NO NO that's too bad
He never left any time to regret
Oh no I'm so sad
I can't do anything for no more

I tried & I tried to work it out
Baby, there is no reason no more
Do whatever you wanna do
Darling I'm the only one for you

So you so what you gonna do
Baby put a gun against me
Gotta go so get out of my head
Today will start better day for you

So you so what you gonna do
Baby put a gun against me
Gotta go so get out of my head
Today will start better day for you

I tried & I tried to work it out
Baby, there is no reason no more
Do whatever you wanna do
Darling I'm the only one for you...

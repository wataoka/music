So gaudy and immoral, I'm the least wanted
I don't give a shit, world's warped anyway
It doesn't worth to clingin' on to that
If that's the moral someone established.
This is the way I chose to be
I'll do it my fuckin' way
I know that others won't understand it
Tired of those warped world
but don't get me wrong
I don't blame anyone
It's nobody's fault when
I can't get what I want
It's nobody's business but mine
The problem is that I give up so easily
Dreams in my head but can't step ahead
I'll keep on going 'till my final day
The Wall that stand tall. I must break down
I just wanna see what's behind
Noisy sound is the what I need
I just wanna witness the moment of the truth
I hate to be forced
I do it the way I like it
Be ambitious, Let the bell of the war toll
Be cautious and watch out!
Watch out!

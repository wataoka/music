Two people just meeting
Barely touch each other
Two spirits greeting
Trying to carry it further

You are one
And I am another
We should be one inside each other

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna run inside my love
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna run inside my love

Two strangers,not strangers
Only lacking the knowing
So willing, feeling isn't it growing

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna run inside my love
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna run inside my love

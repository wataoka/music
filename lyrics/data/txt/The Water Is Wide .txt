The water is wide, I can't cross over
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I

Oh, love is gentle and love is kind
The sweetest flower when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew

There is a ship and she sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

The water is wide, I can't cross over
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I
And both shall row, my love and I

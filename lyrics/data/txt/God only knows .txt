What I'm seeing......Is it real?
What I'm feeling......Is it real?
What I'm doing......Is it real?

There is no regrets, satisfy my curiosities
There is a new world waiting, explore my possibilities
There is no guarantee, just improve my abilities
&lt;Go ahead with your own life Is there any hope in your sight?&gt;
There is a choice to make, setting the right priorities
&lt;You will always be the one, so feel the power
 And you should know the sun comes up - For you&gt;

There is no regrets, satisfy my curiosities
There is a new world waiting, explore my possibilities
There is no guarantee, just improve my abilities
There is a choice to make, setting the right priorities

第二幕

&lt;What is the best you can do? How can you do?&gt;
I was sitting and thinking the other day
&lt;What is the best you can do? How can you do?&gt;
If I fail, I won't throw my passion away
&lt;What is the best you can do? How can you do?&gt;
Just 'cause giving up is not the only way
No matter how it's gonna be, I'll try it anyway

第三幕

Love is such a sweet illusion(Let's come together)
Can't seem to stop my imagination(Goes on forever)
What a ridiculous situation(Another matter)
But I can't deny, I'm faced with a tricky temptation

In the world that keeps on changing
Don't know why my heart is aching
Gotta handle it, no more hesitation
There can be no turning back

God only knows
"My mind is as free as the wind But now what I should do is to fall in love"

God only knows
"I don't need that kind of real things Feels like I'm lost in the labyrinth"

God only knows
"There must be the meaning of life Somehow unexpected happenings thrill me"

God only knows
"Just believe in myself and my dream Anyone could be a hero and heroine"

God only knows
"Though it's not so easy to get through Here I am, I'm sure that things will go my way"

God only knows
"My mind is as free as the wind But now what I should do is to fall in love"

God only knows&lt;Your own happiness, you can find it&gt;
"I don't need that kind of real things Feels like I'm lost in the labyrinth"

God only knows&lt;Your infinity, you can feel it&gt;
"There must be the meaning of life Somehow unexpected happenings thrill me"

God only knows&lt;Opportunity, you can take it&gt;
"Just believe in myself and my dream Anyone could be a hero and heroine"

God only knows&lt;Toward the future, you can make it&gt;
"Though it's not so easy to get through Here I am, I'm sure that things will go my way"

第四幕

&lt;Sailing, you're sailing away And now it's blowing, breeze will take you away&gt;

I feel that my spirits rise
I will survive and just stay alive
Enjoy being alone, the isolation is not always so bad
Another day has gone by, every day goes by
In the sky, there'd be a bridge to a bright tomorrow

&lt;You will find your treasure and share your pleasure Let me tell you...&gt;

第五幕

&lt;Just keep your vision, your dream, and your soul alive Be as you are, I will always be right by your side&gt;

Think about my love and my life
In an uncertain world, face to face with myself
Continue to make progress, day by day and step by step
I've got a good feeling
So I'm gonna keep on trying, life will go on......

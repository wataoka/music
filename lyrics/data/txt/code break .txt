Ain't a boss I'm a leader
non-repeater see what I do best
to steam the floor up I beam up
my mic the magic the wand
brings me so high and beyond
judge all you want ain't nobody can break this bond
ties of gold yours is still a bronze
gonna read ur mind give best response
oh the best for me, yo I'm so far gone from y'all

I'm breaking the code
without letting it blow
cuz I'm getting with it mix with it
then I just go
keeping it down down
moving in silence
I can be so arrogant if I must blow up
supplying anecdote as an antidote, these babylonians
made millions of minions
you don't gonna follow what's shown in my opinion
cuz I made my own path in such a brilliance

Time for me to break break it down
making out with this beat I pound
to let them know that I'm major bounce
trick you out got the player crown
hate on me that's wasting time
21st century never enough time
when you try to copy and pasting mine

already over your head making prime
they love to see me fall like a hole in my parachute
the crooked motivation of your's gonna embarass you
they love the spot light the bloom the blossom
I'm different but I got some to what it takes be a hot
product
no manuals how I'm brought up
all I did was that I took a beat
placed a rhyme then I consequently slaughtered

so you wanna hold me?
tight as locks put it all on me?
ain't nobody can, but call me any moment
I'm a super man, work so SUPER man
one and only not a storm trooper man
easily judged and I'm hated by many
but I gotta lotta love that's more than money plenty
I'm the Doctor check you up in my clinic
don't look back too hard just live it
cuz I'm living in it I've been living in it
I've been doing doing doing doing doing it
say it again
cuz I'm living in it I've been living in it
I've been doing doing doing doing doing it
cuz I'm living in it I've been living in it
I've been doing it alright

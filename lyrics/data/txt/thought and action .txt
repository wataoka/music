Realization of yours and my mind
for the sake of flying
So don't you hesitate in sight

If you wanna swim freely like a fish
first of all throw off your clothes
If you wanna sleep deeply like a kid
first of all don't make a pause
If you really wanna do something special
let yourself go and resist great preassure
If you really wanna do something special your own
we can do we wanna do all

A tender wind is blowing between you and me
just like a strongly push us on the back and knee
A tender wind is blowing between you and me
just like softly touch us on the lip and cheek

Receive uncertain tomorrow
Thought and action blows
blazing with commotion, overflow, tomorrow

Tender winding for you and me
wash away your vanity
softly touch us on the cheek and sanity

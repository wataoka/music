Somewhere in the Milky Way
Somewhere deep in outer space
As he travels all the galaxy
Does he feel as lonely as me

Out there the comets fly
Out there where world collide
As he chases all his wildest dreams
Does he ever dreams of me

Star bright
Shining so high above
How I wish he could hear me
Star bright
Send me the one I love
Make my wishes all come true tonight
Star bright

Wish that I hadn't been so shy
Wish that he could read my mind
Even through he may be lightyears away
I know he's in my heart to stay

Star bright
Shinin so high above
How I wish he were near me
Star bright
Send me the one I love
Make my wishes all come true tonight
Star bright

Star bright
First star I see tonight
Wish I may,I wish I might
Star bright
Wish I could hold him tight
Make my wish come true tonight
Star bright
When he were by my side
Wish I may,I wish I might
Star bright
Wish I could make it right
Make my wish come true tonight

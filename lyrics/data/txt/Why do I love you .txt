You crush my flower
and you crush my prayer
Take away the love from my heart
'cause I don't know
Why do I love you more

Don't kill me Don't kill me

You hit my hands
and I lick your shin
Take away the blood from my head
'cause I don't know
How can I love you more

Don't kill me Don't kill me

Don't kill me Don't kill me
Don't make me pull the trigger on you
Don't kill me Why do I love you
Tell me baby Why do I love you

Don't kill me Don't kill me

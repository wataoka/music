I wanna be kind all the time when I'm with you
But again my words make you sad
If I had a car, I'd dive you around the city
I promise you someday it's gonna be true

Every night I try to find you in my dream
I'm looking for your smile, it's like a beautiful sky
All I can do is just singing a song with my heart
Hey let me play precious songs for you

I sing a song every day every night
I sing a song to your heart
I sing a song with my heart
I sing a song for you

Look at the rings shining in the glass case
I know you want them, but you pretend not to want
All I can do is just singing a song with my heart
Hey let me play precious songs for you

I sing a song every day every night
I sing a song to your heart
I sing a song with my heart
I sing a song for you

I sing a song every day every night
I sing a song to your heart
I sing a song with my heart
I sing a song for you

狂いそうになるまで
ウーファスピーカーのそばで

Don't you get it wrong delight?
There's no time to fade away
Have you ever seen the end?
Feel the final warning

'Cause I gonna wait for light in the shadow
Please don't stop the noise for me out of the blue

Don't you get it wrong delight?
There's no time to fade away
Have you ever seen the end?
Feel the final warning,together

Kill me, kill me saturday night
Kill me, kill me saturday night
Kill me, kill me saturday night
Kill me, kill me saturday night...

狂いそうになるまで
ウーファスピーカーのそばで...

music makes the rainbow...

Kill me, kill me saturday night
Kill me, kill me saturday night
Kill me, kill me saturday night
Kill me, kill me saturday night...

music makes the rainbow...

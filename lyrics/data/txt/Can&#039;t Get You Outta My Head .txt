Can't get you outta my head, got you into my heart 
I'm going crazy just to be with you 

You always stay on my mind, most all of the time 
And I don't know what I am gonna do 

When you're far away from me 
Everything you mean to me becomes so clear 
I can't wait to have you here 

This could be the perfect place for me 
If I could have you around to make it right 

I see your face in my daydreams 
And through the night 
I wake up missing you so much 
That's why I just... 

Can't get you outta my head, got you into my heart 
I'm going crazy just to be with you 

You always stay on my mind, most all of the time 
And I don't know what I am gonna gonna do 

Can't get you outta my head, got you into my heart 
I'm going crazy just to be, just to be, just to be with you 

You always stay on my mind, most all of the time 
And I don't know what I am gonna do 

I can't wait to have you with me 
To do all the things we do that make you true and oh so special 
I count every second that I'm away 
As a waste of time that I could spend with you 

I see your face in my daydreams 
And through the night 
I wake up missing you so much 
That's why I just... 

Can't get you outta my head, got you into my heart 
I'm going crazy just to be with you 

You always stay on my mind, most all of the time 
And I don't know what I am gonna gonna do 

Can't get you outta my head, got you into my heart 
I'm going crazy just to be, just to be, just to be with you 

You always stay on my mind, most all of the time 
And I don't know what I am gonna gonna do 

Can't get you outta my head, got you into my heart 

You always stay on my mind, most all of the time

'What's the matter
Such an early morning?'

Just wanted call
And hear your voice
I know you're still in dream
But gotta to tell you
Before I'm leaving here

'Things you always do
Is only for you
It's not changed
Since we started in this place'

Sorry, gave nothing to you
'Oh, it's not your word
So just go, my friend'

I know you're staying
You know I'm going
Keep two hearts one
Anytime wow wow
You see your future
I see my dreamrng
There's no good by
Even being ail alone

By the corner seat
At late in the bar
The song reminds me
Blue air message from you
Please remember
And give me your song
Next to me once again

I know you're staying
You know I'm going
Still believing
No end what we're gonna do
You keep your future
I keep my dreaming
There's no turn back
Even being all alone

I know you're staying
You know I'm going
Keep two hearts one
Anytime wow wow
You see your future
I see my dreamrng
There's no good by
Even being ail alone

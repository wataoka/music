Summer has now come
Wow!
The time to jump at the beach has now arrived

Come on, lets play with us
Why don't we hop around the hot summer shore
Forget all the boring stuff we got to care and have fun

The sun shines bright upon the sky
Tanning our skin hot and brown
This place is our play ground for us to play

Everyday we have to bother with many shits
I know how it really suck but for now why not party and jump all night long with us
I get how you feel so dull to face problems you would never want but for now lets jump and sing all night long

Jump now!
Shake the floor and shake the earth with both of your feet
Create and feel the beat

Jump as high as the sky

The sun is falling into the blue ocean
Coloring the scenery into orange but its not over

Even if the round glowing moon comes rising the fun never ends and will last forever
Lets dance
Jump until next morning
Party all day
Let's all hold hands and jump around the fire

Do not be scared
You can always come back here anytime
We won't leave you so do not worry
This place will stay forever

Stars shine and light from up high
Telling us that the party will not end
Hey, are you ready to jump now?

We have to bother with many shits
I know how it really suck but for now why not party and jump all night long with us
I get how you feel so dull to face problems you would never want but for now lets jump and sing all night long

Jump now!

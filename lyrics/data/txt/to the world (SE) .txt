The music of UVER SIX World, here comes
The world wants “Revolution”
The notes we create lead to the beginning of our Revolution
To the world

The sounds will never die, will live forever
The world wants  “Revolution”
The notes we create lead to the beginning of our Revolution
To the world

You say UVERworld
Let me hear your voice more
You gotta scream

You say UVERworld
You see
We will have one world
Let me hear your voice more
You gotta scream

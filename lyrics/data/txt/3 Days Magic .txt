Are you tricking me? 3 days magic
Are you tricking me into falling in love?
Are you tricking me? 3 days magic
Magic, your trick, terrific…

Fabulous!
意外な優しさが
どストライクゾーンに
キテる キテる
第一印象から God, you're so hot
Frivolous!
気付けば 目が合ってた
さりげなしにsay hallo
もう少し近付きたい
二度目の夜

右手にわざと触れた
Tell me what you wanna do
I wanna…Let you know that I'm so into you…
三日目のきょう、それは
Tell you what I really want
I wanna…つまり 本気のハジマリ

I don't know how you got me…
3 days magic 本気で恋しちゃいそう
I realize now…you got me!
3 days magic Ah ha
I don't know how…
You got me! 3 days magic
ココロがのぞけたらなぁ
I realize now…

You got me! 3 days magic Ah ha
恋が花咲く前の
モラトリアムが今
揺れ動いているみたい

ここからが Dangerous!
瞳の向こう側
映しだす 感情
Breakin' out, breakin' out
見透かされる気がした

目をそらしちゃう前に
Tell me what you wanna do
I wanna…Let you know that I'm so into you
確信に迫ってよ
Tell you what I really want, I wanna…
つまり もうはじまってるの

I don't know how…You got me!
3 days magic このまま 止まらないで
I realize now…You got me!
3 days magic Ah ha
I don't know how…You got me!
3 days magic気持ちを 隠さないで
I realize now…You got me!
3 days magic Ah ha

You are the first to shake my heart
You are the last to kiss me so
You are the best to hang out with
You are the first to touch my heart
You are the last to love me so
You are the best to make me smile
You are the one…

Are you tricking me? 3 days magic
Are you tricking me into falling in love?
Are you tricking me? 3 days magic
Magic, your trick, terrific…
I don't know how…
You got me! 3 days magic
本気で恋しちゃいそう
I realize now…
You got me! 3 days magic Ah ha
You got me! 3 days magic
このまま止まらないで
I realize now…
You got me! 3 days magic Ah ha

Are you tricking me? 3 days magic
Are you tricking me into falling in love?
Are you tricking me? 3 days magic
Magic, your trick, terrific…

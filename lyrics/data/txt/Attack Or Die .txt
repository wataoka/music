Sadness fills up my heart tonight
I am gazing at the ceiling all night long
Madness is hiding in my mind
Cant't help losing myself
There's no way to run away

Oh my destiny, place where I belong
I don't throw away all my memories
They'll forget as time goes by but I don't care
I won't hold it back
No pain, no gain

Set it free / Breakin'free / Break me free
There's a reason to fight
I don't cry out any more
Life is not so easy
I have to search for something

Let it be
There's a reason to fight
I don't cry out any more
If I can not walk alone, the darkness never ends

Breakin'free
(Go where the darkness ends)
Breakin'free
(Sun rises, shines on me)

Let it be
There's a reason to fight
I don't cry out any more
If I can not walk alone, the darkness never ends

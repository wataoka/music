I am a lamb asleep on the ground of life
I see stars in the dark insulting my thin dignity
Loyal faith for you can let my hands reach to a shear
I sacrifice my wool and let the blood die out

I believe in your footsteps
But no, no, I doubt that you are the savior
If you really are the god
Tell me how I can handle tommorow
I never find myself worth breathing
I am such a timid,little lamb
But you still keep me aliveâ€¦

Gracefull winds blow to scoop the field of green
When the bare ground appears, that is my grave where at lie
And when I close my eyes at the edge of life in chilled
You harrass the clouds to set me under the sleet

I believe in your footsteps
But no, no, You are not the one responsible
If I blame it all on god
I would never learn through my yesterdays
I can't find the way to fall in to my dreams
I am still groaning at the darkening sky
But will you still give me more time?

You were born in between my sleepless sheats
You recklessly grew and overtook on me

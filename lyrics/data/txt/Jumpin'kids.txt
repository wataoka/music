In any town there is a wicked boy
pumpin' around my name is S.H.I.N.
I always try to find what is the joy
and also all of my friends are try to find it

★All of the Boys are Rapping
　All of the Girls are Pumpin'
　All of the Kids are Jumpin' to the playground
　All of the Boys are Rapping
　All of the Girls are Pumpin'

Don't have to do the work out everyday
Oh mom you just can go out to the playground
If you don't say "You have homework" today
No complain for DOMINO'S pizza dinner

Oh mother you don't have to rule
all of the thing you want to say is what I knew
But Don't worry about it cause I love you forever and ever

As all the years just pass me by
and all the things I've never tried

手を伸ばした光に
Gotta find my place
行き先は未開の地
and going on

手に入れたパズル
喜びや希望 過ち後悔も
つなぐ自分だけの未来へ

Oh break up pieces of me
and start again
'cause the puzzle I had wasn't working then
Oh pieces of me
and nothing's changed
目を閉じて映る絵信じんて
Oh pieces of me
I hope I can

Yeah I am broken up in two
Just matching oerfectly with you

手に入れたパズル
あてはめて作るまだ見ぬ光景を
つなぎ自分だけの未来へ

Oh break up peaces of me
and start again
'cause the puzzle I had wasn't working then
Oh pieces of me
and nothing's changed
目を閉じて映る絵信じんて
Oh pieces of me
I hope I can

There is nothng to change
I've been here before
There is nothing to change
What I'm looking for
There is nothing to change
in this this strangers war
Anymore

Break up pieces of me
and start again
'cause the puzzle I had wasn't working then
Oh pieces of me
and nothing's changed
目を閉じて映る絵信じんて
Oh pieces of me
I hope I can

Get it together again
Back together again

I look above the stars are bright
Yet I'm blinded by the light
Heaven seems so far away
Come back to me someday

The sky seems so blue
They load me to you
Somewhere there's a place in my heart
In the skies of love

I pray upon a star tonight
for the Gods to shine a light
There's a place that's far away
I'll meet you there one day

My faith lies with you
Protect all you do
There's always a place in my heart
in the skies of love.

I look above the stars are bright
Yet I'm blinded by the light
Heaven seems so far away
Come back to me someday

The sky seems so blue
They load me to you
Somewhere there's a place in my heart
In the skies of love

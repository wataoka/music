Walking down the street tonight
Like every night nowhere to go
No one on the street tonight
And no one waiting up at home

Watching as my cigarette is spinning smoke into the wind
Watching as the time goes by
I think about the fix I'm in

Only you can come to save me
Being all alone has made me shake down
Break down

Give me everything I'm missing
Give me deep and soft, sweet kissing
Touch my skin

My medicine
All I want is you to hold and comfort me come on you're
My medicine
When I'm feeling lost and weak you're what I'm wishing give me
My medicine
I can feel a passion from my one affliction
Loving him is medicine

I got hooked on your love nicotine, yeah

Walking down this lonely road
I found you spinning up like smoke

You don't even have to chase me
Waiting for so long has made me stressed up
Messed up

Give me everything I'm missing
Give me deep and soft, sweet kissing
Touch my skin
I'm giving in you're

My medicine
All I want is you to hold and comfort me come on you're
My medicine
When I'm feeling lost and weak you're what I'm wishing give me
My medicine
I can feel a passion from my one affliction
Loving him

Loving him is medicine
My medicine, yeah
Loving him is medicine
My medicine, yeah
Loving only him is medicine

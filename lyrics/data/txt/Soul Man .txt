Comin' to you on a dusty road
Good lovin', I've got a truck load
And when you get it you got some
So don't worry 'cause I'm comin'

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

And that ain't all
Got what I got the hard way
And I'll make it better
Each and every day
So honey, don't you fret
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

I was brought up on a side street
Listen now
I learned how to love
Before I could eat
I was educated at Woodstock
When I start loving, oh I can't stop

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

Grab the rope and I'll pull you in
Give you hope
And be your only boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm talkin' about a soul man
I'm a soul man

I close my eyes and I keep seeing things
Rainbow waterfalls
sunny liquid dream

Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt
Gotta get to you
But I don't know bow

Call me, Call me
Let me know it's alright
Call me, call me
Don't you think it's 'bout time
Please won't you call and

Ease my mind
Reasons for me to find you
Peace of mind
What can I do
to get me to you

I had your number quite some time ago
Back when we were one
But I had to grow

Ten thousand years I've searched it seems and now
Gotta get to you
Won't you tell me how

Call me, Call me
Let me know you are there
Call me, call me
I wanna know you still care
Come on now won't you

Ease my mind
Reasons for me to find you
Peace of mind
What can I do
to get me to you

Ease my mind
Reasons for me to find you
Peace of mind
Reasons for living my life
Ease my mind
Reasons for me to know you
Peace of mind
What can I do
to get me to you

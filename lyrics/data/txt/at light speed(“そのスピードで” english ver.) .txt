Kick off my muddy worn out shoes.
The phone is ringing.
I am in my room with no air.

This night I lost my fairy tale
when she came to me
and put her magic spell on me.

Why is everything precious
to me going away?
The devil in my heart's waving to me.

Sweet hot chocolate warms up
my frozen body
and always makes me feel alright.

Let's quickly blow out
the flame of this long lit lamp.
Oh let us trust fate in this limited world.
I can see myself crying in the mirror.
Oh...

Cosmic light
filters out through the wings
of my sadness
on its way to the lonely moon.
The starry night knows how I feel.
Pieces of my heart disperse
like stardust lost in the galaxy

broken down at light speed.

Night and day I can't find my way out
and there's nothing left.
I cry and laugh and sleep and play.

Such a shy and trembling devil lives
in my heart and he is smiling at me,
makes me feel so sad.

If I can break this spell, “my angel”
maybe I can take one step
ahead this morning.

Reach out my hand to the sun,
feel the wind and raindrops,
break the mirror of this nightmare.

Before I lose my will,
I wanna scream my true feeling
but I know it won't change
anything at all.
So I take a deep breath and
just keep moving forward.

Cosmic light
filters out through the wings
of my sadness
on its way to the lonely moon.
The starry night knows how I feel
Pieces of my heart disperse
like stardust lost in the galaxy

moving on at light speed.

I'm heading to the stars
as my heart desires,
I'll never lose my way,
I don't care
if people see and make fun of me
when I stumble and burst into tears
as this world keeps
on changing at light speed
moving on at light speed.

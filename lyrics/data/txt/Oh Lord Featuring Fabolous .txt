Hello, Brooklyn, NGY,
だまらす　Fab & 69

I ride it, latest Rarri　横にゃBarbie
他とちゃうたてがみ　そう　この毛並み
奴らはラリっとるで　産めねぇMoney
俺なら続くラリー　錦織ばり
引っかかりもせん　俺のレーダー
撃ち落とすのみ　ドラマ無しのInvaders
映画みてぇな生活は明確な計画と努力
お分かり?そう別格　Oh Lord

背に十字架　Oh Lord
刻むDrama Oh Lord
誰が別格　Oh Lord
Now we young OG
Oh Lord... yeah

Oh lord, time to go hard, I had to go for it
Back then, I moved thru snow hard, I had a snowboard
Found Out, the boy flow hard, they payin dough for it
Still had to come Bogard, til ya bro scored
They just see me ballin, they don't know I practiced
Slept on me til I showed them that I aint the mattress
Now my life a movie and I'm wit ya favorite actress
Lookin like we made it, buts it's all what he Created Oh Lord

背に十字架　Oh Lord
刻むDrama Oh Lord
誰が別格　Oh Lord
Now we young OG
Oh Lord... yeah
Hello, Brooklyn, NGY,
だまらす　Fab & 69

You don't know my struggle and what I overcame
You ain't feel my pain, and had no novacane
You ain't had the kinda luck clovers couldn't change
You ain't cop the Rover Range, and then nearly drove insane
But swerve, give them some swerve
That road to riches, its got some curves
Got to keep grinding so you can keep shining
That ladder of success I got to keep climbing

奴落ちたのは一体誰のせい?
神のみぞ知る　成功の裏のPain
I swear　決して俺は誤摩化さねぇ
ほら　言ってる通り　ヨソ道はねぇ
It's like the　フサイチコンコルド
Flying B　に乗って先祖に報告
この羽根なら出来ねぇ冒涜
正々堂々と築くこの王国　Oh Lord

背に十字架　Oh Lord
刻むDrama Oh Lord
誰が別格　Oh Lord
Now we young OG
Oh Lord... yeah

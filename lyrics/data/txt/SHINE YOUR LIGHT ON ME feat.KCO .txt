Shine your light on me, all though the day and the night
You're always up there in the sky
Shine your light on me, every day forever
輝きだす期待
Whenever, wherever, however and ever it's gonna be
Together, not lair, together, two of us
My tears, your tears, we swear meening of life
We'll be truth
You are my star

Tonight's the night
Let's run away for a while
見つけたい
空を走るくらい
弾けだす未来
some place to hide
that no one can ever find
曖昧なStyle
自由ならいいんじゃない
so come with me

you give me butterflies flying so high
every time I'm with you around
奇跡を呼ぶ瞬間
眩しすぎて

Shine your light on me, all though the day and the night
You're always up there in the sky
Shine your light on me, every day forever
輝きだす期待
Whenever, wherever, however and ever it's gonna be
Together, not lair, together, two of us
My tears, your tears, we swear meening of life
We'll be truth
You are my star

Spice the sky
Just streaming the twilight
キミの隣り
怖いものなんかない
未知なる世界
it don't matter
even if you're far away
見上げれば
一人でも変わらない
I sing for you

you're like an angel
the heavenly smile
makes me feel that I'm in the paradise
季節を越え吹く風
キラめいてく

Shine your light on me, all though the day and the night
You're always up there in the sky
Shine your light on me, every day forever
輝きだす期待
Whenever, wherever, however and ever it's gonna be
Together, not lair, together, two of us
My tears, your tears, we swear meening of life
We'll be truth
You are my star

Shine your light on me,
all though the day and through the night
You're always up there in the sky
Shine your light on me, every day forever
輝きだす期待

Shine your light on me, all though the day and the night
You're always up there in the sky
Shine your light on me, every day forever
輝きだす期待
Whenever, wherever, however and ever it's gonna be
Together, not lair, together, two of us
My tears, your tears, we swear meening of life
We'll be truth
You are my star

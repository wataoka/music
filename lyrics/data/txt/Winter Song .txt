The dusk is gaining ground, lights flicker all around
And as I walk the lonely streets, the snow is falling ever faster
Looking to the sky, I wonder where you are,
The way you came into my life, filling every day with laughter

Almost blinded by the snowflakes on my face
Despite the chill I feel the warmth of your embrace
Intoxicated now, I stagger like a fool
I feel that surely I could float away...

I want to show you everything I see, the way I'm feeling
I need to be with you tonight, to hold your arms around me
My love for you is deeper than the deepest snows of winter
The greatest gift I ever had was you.

This sparkling crystal world, this magic winter land,
If I could share it all with you, and make-believe forever after

Like a blanket over everything in sight,
In the hush I hear the silence of the night
The snow has covered all the streets we walked along
I hope you still remember me tonight...

I want to show you everything I see, the way I'm feeling
I need to be with you tonight, to feel you all around me
My love for you is deeper than the deepest snows of winter
The greatest gift I ever had

Can't remember feeling this way before
Do you know, do you understand what's going through my heart
Well the way that I love you, I just hope you feel it too,
Tonight wherever you are...

I want to show you everything I see, the way I'm feeling
I need to be with you tonight, to hold your arms around me
My love for you is deeper than the deepest snows of winter
The greatest gift I ever had was you,
The greatest gift I ever had was you.

This is my song for you...

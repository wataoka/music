Now let's get married
No need to wait
and waste our time
Why do we have to
carry on this way?
No one can keep us apart
So, let's get married
right away
I'll wake you up
in the morning, my baby
Sweeten your coffee
with my kiss
And in the night
I will hold you so tightly
Whisperin' the words
you long to hear
So, let's get married
Why don't you ask me
and stop hesitating?
Just think how
happy we can be
You & me in a small
house with a dog
So, let's get married
right away
So, let's get married
right away
When you are blue
and so down, my baby
I'll give a smile
to cheer you up
But if I get sad and lonely
Please hug me close
and wipe my tears
So, let's get married
I just don't know
how to live without you
Maybe it's nice
to have our kids some day
And this is all I can say
Now let's get married
right away
So, let's get married
right away
So, let's get married
right away

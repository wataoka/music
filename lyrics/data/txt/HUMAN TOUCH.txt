CAN I FIND THE WORDS TO TELL YOU
HOW I LIVE BETWEEN THE WALLS OF STEEL AND STONE
HOW I CLOSE MY EYES TO FIND SOME KIND OF RAPTURE
IN A WORLD WHERE YOU CAN FEEL SO ALL ALONE

INSIDE I'M FULL OF LIGHT AND LAUGHTER
THERE'S A FLAME THAT BURNS IN ME
I NEED A WAY TO SET IT FREE

WHEN YOU FIND LOVE IN YOUR HEART
YOU CAN BELIEVE FROM THE START
DREAMS THEY COME TRUE
IT ALL COMES TO YOU,OH ALL AT ONCE
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN HUMAN TOUCH

I SEE WANTING IN YOUR EYES
AND I WONDER WILL
DO WE SIMPLY FIND OURSELVES
AWAKENING
AS ANGELS TOUCHED
THE HEART STRINGS OF OUR SOULS

WE CAN FIND A WAY
TO BREAK THE MADNESS
TAKE MY HAND AND COME WITH ME
TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FEEL

WHEN YOU FIND LOVE IN YOUR HEART
THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYE IS A STAR
CHANGE THAT YOU FEEL
HELPS YOU TO HEAL FROM ALL THE REST
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN HUMAN TOUCH

TELL ME THAT YOUR LOVE
WILL LIVE FOREVER
TAKE YOUR HAND AND TOUCH MY FACE
OH,THE WARMTH OF YOUR SWEET EMBRACE

WHEN YOU FIND LOVE IN YOUR HEART
NOTHING CAN TEAR IT APART
NOT MAN OR STEEL
NOTHING IS REAL EXCEPT FOR LOVE
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN HUMAN TOUCH
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN HUMAN TOUCH

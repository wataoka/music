Remember all those days we shared
How could I forget what you did for me
Suddenly you were there to find the truth
You gave to me something I wanted most

Maybe it's too late to tell you how I feel
I didn't know what you did when sadness came to me
What can I say, what can I do, where do I go
You are the air giving life

All I need is you. Stay with me by my side
It's for sure you are water to give me what I need
Take my hand leading to the times ahead
It's our song of hope with gratitude

All I need is you. Stay with me by my side
It's for sure you are the road to make all my destiny
Take my hand leading to the times ahead
Forever, I sing my little song

Maybe it's too late to tell you how I feel
I didn't know what you did when sadness came to me
What can I say, what can I do, where do I go
You are the air giving life

All I need is you. Stay with me by my side
It's for sure you are water to give me what I need
Take my hand leading to the times ahead
It's our song of hope with gratitude

All I need is you. so please! Stay with me by my side
It's for sure you are the road to make all my destiny
Take my hand leading to the times ahead
Forever, I sing my little song

You make the sweetest music, you are so good for me
Everytime we're together, automatic harmony

'Cause I always thought that life was a hard-luck story
And love was a savin'glory When you came along
Taught me how to sing a happy song

You make the sweetest music, you are so good to me
We're gonna last forever, two-hearted melody

Mama always said that I'd find the right somebody
I must have been looking the other way
You came from afar played my heart just like a sweet guitar

(You make the music sweet sweet music, you are good for me)
(You make the music sweet sweet music, you are good for me)
(beautyâ€¦)

So,if you're feeling left behind and so down-hearted
There is love to find, so just get started
Maybe it's just overdue 'Cause if it happens to me,
it sure can happen to you

You make the sweetest music,you are so good for me
Everytime we're together, automatic harmony
(You make the sweetest music)

You make the sweetest music, you are so good to me
We're gonna last forever, two-hearted melody
(You make the sweetest music,baby)

You make the sweetest music,you are so good for me
Everytime we're together, automatic harmony
(You make the sweetest music)

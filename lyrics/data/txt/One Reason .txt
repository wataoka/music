Slit the throat of reason and reality
Cut myself and scream for their insanity
Wake up to this nightmare that will never end
The main attraction of this twisted master plan

Trust nothing but pain to get me
through the daze
Sleep with one eye open not to be their prey
Fist against my face they bring me to my knees
The pressure's crushing down so hard
I can't break free

When I can feel my skin crawl
When I'm about to crack
The hunger for revenge
gives me strength to stand

I will be your deadman
With nothing but this blood on my hands
Stuck in your“wonderland”
I just want to make you bleed like me

Everyday goes by without a second thought
Living in a perfect and controlled project
A puppet of their sick perversion's appetite
Will I be trapped inside this hell until I die?

So what if no one cares
Enough to make a change
I give my bleeding heart out for one reason

I will be your deadman
With nothing but this blood on my hands
Stuck in your“wonderland”
I want to make you bleed just like me

So make me your deadman
With only poison in my veins
Stuck in your“wonderland”
Stagnated by the passivity
I'm gonna make you bleed like me

Far to the land
I will take you there
To your Homeland of evergreen
Every moment of life
is a quest for the land
Deep in love and mystery

Come from the shore of eternity
You are my everlasting song
I want to be
the only one for you
we'll never be apart
Come now, fly with me...
Far to the land
I will fly me up there
To the sun of eternity
Evry wish and desire
Leads me back to the land
Deep in love and mystery

my everlasting song...
Come fly with me...

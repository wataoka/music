It's easy to talk bad about what other's do
How does it feel when they talk bad about you?
Will you fight back?
Will you get all mad?
You know what?
Hey! let's just chill out

Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool
Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool

You don't like what's going on around you?
Then this is your chance to change yourself
Can you open up?
Can you take it easy
You know what?
Hey! let's just chill out

Don't need no fire, listen to the voices
How about listening to someone else for a change

You don't like what's going on around you?
You know what?
Hey! let's just chill out

Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool
Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool

Can you open up?
Can you take it easy

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow

Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool
Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool

Ah...
That's right, man
Just be cool

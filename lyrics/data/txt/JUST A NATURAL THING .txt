We can go everywhere
But can't move alone
Don't need a fake driver's liscence
The road will be laid behind us
On the cross roads
Let's sing that new song

That's how people balance their lifes
And struggle in it
That's how people balance their lifes
And struggle in it
Without thinking'Cause the world is like a maze
That's why we have to watch every step
'Cause the world is like a maze
That's why we have to watch every step

'Cause the world is like a maze
That's why we have to watch every step
'Cause the world is like a maze
That's why we have to watch every step

Take-I 20 to west, then head
for north on-I 17
The goal is waiting for us at
the end of-I 134 G・H Home!

That's how people balance their lifes
And struggle in it
That's how people balance their lifes
And struggle in it
Without thinking

It's just a natural thing

'Cause the world is like a maze
That's why we have to watch every step
'Cause the world is like a maze
That's why we have to watch every step

La La La…

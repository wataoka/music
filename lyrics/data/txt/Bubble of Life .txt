Swirl of Frenzy losing your mind gradually
In the insane vortex you drift through the crowd

Bubble of life you're believing,
Bubble of life you're growing
Nothing else you can focus
Nowhere, nowhere you're going

Let's dance and jump! jump! jump!
You hit me bump! bump! bump!
Let's drink and hip! hip! hip!
Just go and get a grip

This is the no end night
You hit me bang! bang! bang!
Consuming rapidly
And all the night we'll hang

Running so desperately as good as the others
Scrape your soul again with no cover
Let it grow on but you know nothing ever comforts what you need
Its worthless see? Those everything you feed
The crazy party never ends just like our continuous greed

Let's dance and jump! jump! jump!
You hit me bump! bump! bump!
Let's drink and hip! hip! hip!
Just go and get a grip

Let's party up! up! up!
As they go down down down
Drown in the endless night
With all our fake gilt crowns

Swirl of Frenzy losing your mind gradually
In the insane vortex you drift through the crowd

Bubble of life you're believing,
Bubble of life you're growing
Nothing else you can focus
Nowhere, nowhere you're going

Running so desperately your trying to death
for what's the only one thing you need
Inside you? Outside them? Which side where?
All the truth you bleed
It's just like bubbles see? Yeah, everything they plead
The endless circle whirling on round and round
we go with our greed

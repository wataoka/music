Suddenly !
The things come to me It's dawn
Great hurry !
Run without taking a rest
Lose control !
The things begin to riot
I'm in cold !
Run without taking a rest

Go away !
I'll have to confront danger
Go highway !
Run without taking a rest
Kill the things !
The things keep on rioting
Beat the things !
Run without taking a rest

It's so hard on me
Thunder runs through my heart
My body does not move
I regret but is it too late ?

I say,
“No more !”
I won't give up on my luck
“Why not !”
I keep on fighting it back
“Take the chance !”
I won't be stuck here any more Feel free already !
“No way !”
I know I can still stand up
“Not yet !”
I feel my chance is right up
“Grab it now !”
It'll be coming up anytime So, just get ready !

Overlook !
Never done anything wrong It's ture
Don't fall sick !
I wanna change the world
Lose control !
The things begin to riot
I'm in cold !
I wanna change the world

It's gnawing at me
I break into a sweat
My body becomes stiff
I regret but is it too late ?

I say,
“No more !”
I won't give up on my luck
“Why not !”
I keep on fighting it back
“Take the chance !”
I won't be stuck here any more Feel free already !
“No way !”
I know I can still stand up
“Not yet !”
I feel my chance is right up
“Grab it now !”
It'll be coming up anytime So, just get ready !

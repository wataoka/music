No, I don't need some drugs  Just I want myself
We face with difficulty one last effort
Yes, anybody hurts lead too hard life
But we can share joys and sorrows with each other

With the best will in the world, we can't be perfect
But it's early to give up
With the best will in the world, we can't be good loser
'Cause we're dreamer, never say die

I don't need some drugs I want myself
Stand in block our ways something.
We lead too fuck in' hard life.

Fight for myself. Fight for yourself.
Fight for myself. Fight for yourself.

Why don't you tell me friend? Make it know to me
You don't have to shoulder all Take it easy
Why don't you kiss me baby? I'm waiting so long
Give me some more your smile Don't give me sad look

Why don't you tell me? Talk to me.
You don't have to shoulder all Give me some more your smile.

Fight for myself. Fight for yourself.
Fight for myself. Fight for yourself.

Drugs can't kill teens, spirits any more

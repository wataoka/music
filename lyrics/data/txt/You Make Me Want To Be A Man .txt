(Chorus)
I really wanna tell you something
This is just the way I am
I really wanna tell you something, but I can't
You make me want to be a man
Arguments that have no meaning
This is just the way I am
You really wanna tell me something, but you can't
You make me what to be a man
The thunder and the rain called you and you came
We didn't need to say much to communicate
Now it's different, 99％ is misinterpreted
Chorus

Every word you say finds a home in me
Nothing that anyone could ever say
Could hurt me like this
Baby please, don't light that cigarette
Don't light that cigarette

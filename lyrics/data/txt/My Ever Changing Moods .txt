Daylight turns to moonlight and I'm at my best
Praising the way it all works gazing upon the best
The cool before the warm
The calm after the storm

I wish to stay forever, letting this be my food
But I'm caught up in a whirlwind and my ever changing moods

Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet for me won't be too soon

The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast

I wish we'd move together, this time the bosses sued
But we're caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood

Teardrops turn to children who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through another's evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late

I wish we'd wake up one day, an' everyone feel moved
But we're caught up in the dailies and an ever changing moods
Evil turns to statues and masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to if the choice was mine
The past is knowledge - the present our mistake
And the future we always leave too late

I wish we'd come to our senses and see there is no truth
In those who promote the confusion for this ever changing moods

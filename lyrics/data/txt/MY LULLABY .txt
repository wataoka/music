愛欲に埋もれた 阿婆擦れのDREAM
無用な体を 貪りなさい
醜悪と化した 孤独なGIRL
滴る涙は 悲嘆 SO SAD

Yeah it's my life
Let's forget about the past

But if god saw gained an insight in my heart
Sing to me a lullaby as I can sleep yeah

愚考の牢獄 行き場所が無い
自由を求めて おやすみなさい

Yeah it's my life
Let's forget about the past

But if god saw gained an insight in my heart
Sing to me a lullaby as I can sleep yeah

孤独な LITTLE GIRL
悲嘆 SO SAD
孤独な LITTLE GIRL
おやすみなさい

Yeah it's my life
Let's forget about the past

But if god saw gained an insight in my heart
Sing to me a lullaby as I can sleep yeah
But if god saw gained an insight in my heart
Sing to me a lullaby as I can sleep yeah

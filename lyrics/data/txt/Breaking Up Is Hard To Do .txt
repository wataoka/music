Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go them I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know,I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up
I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try
Come on, baby, let's start a new
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know,I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up
I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try
Come on, baby, let's start a new
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

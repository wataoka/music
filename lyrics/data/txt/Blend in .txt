they work hard to blend in, just a few to mention
yeah so it seems

they work hard to blend in
but it's all pretending
like a dream

we have been together in good and bad times
we've fought the crimes for years
is this all life has to give?
we have been apart & lost our feelings
well, when the night comes fallen in
then I know why I choose this life

oh, let it be a trend, u talk to me
early in the morning,
we're here all day and nite

Oh, we have been through the good and bad times
we're working side by side
is this all life has to give?

they work hard to blend in, just a few to mention
yeah so it seems

they work hard to blend in
but it's all pretending
like a dream

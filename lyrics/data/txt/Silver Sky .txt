So long, light of dawn
darkness, take me in soundlessly holding on

In the depths silent world, long ago
all that will remain broken heart, farewell

Memories of better days
locked within in hopes that we will remember
someday we may wake to find sunrise

Silver sky, falls upon you and I
another hope fades away into night
distant melodies, a sweet lullaby
will lead me to you

Firefly, glows upon you and I
another hope fades away into the lonely night
when morning comes, the gentle voice will lead you
to the light

Close your eyes as the stars grow dim
she whispers now, an everlasting vow
Hava faith in your heart when hope is forgotten
Follow the twilight

Silver sky, falls upon you and I
another hope fades away into night
distant melodies, a sweet lullaby
will lead me to you

Firefly, glows upon you and I
another hope fades away into the lonely night
when morning comes, the gentle voice will lead you
to the light

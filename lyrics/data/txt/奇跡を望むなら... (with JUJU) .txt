“Ur not alone”,that's what u said to me
U taught me that I'm not alone, in ur sweet n tender ways
Things may have turned a little different than before
If I hadn't discovered that, u were there to guide me through

Sometimes I feel as though if I'm alone
This world keeps turning round n round leaving, me behind
In the darkness of the night my broken heart can't take
Anymore than what's left behind, in this tender heart of mine

If there can be a single miracle,
I'll wish to free my sorrows all away
There's nothing in this world, that I'd rather have
Than to feel your warm embrace again
Should there be a single miracle,
I'll wish the light of hope to guide our way
There's nothing like our love, our lives together
yesterday, today, and forever...

Catch myself thinking bout the yesterdays,
Of this bittersweet, love affair that keeps me captive
Can't let go of the love we left behind,
I don't know how or when my heart can learn to feel the love again

Reality can be so vain and cruel
I know I have to face my life without ur love?
Can't believe my life must go on without u
I'll keep the memories of our past, without it I cud never last...

If there can be a single miracle,
I'll wish to free my sorrows all away
There's nothing in this world, that I'd rather have
Than to feel ur warm embrace again
Should there be a single miracle,
I'll wish the light of hope to guide our way
There's nothing like our love, our lives together
yesterday, today, and forever...

Imagine what our future can hold
If only possibilities can erase, broken promises
And all that has been, if I can believe...again

If there can be a single miracle,
I'll wish to free my sorrows all away
There's nothing in this world, that I'd rather have
Than to feel ur warm embrace again
Should there be a single miracle,
I'll wish the light of hope to guide our way
There's nothing like our love, our lives together
yesterday, today, and forever...

Wishing for a miracle...

My birthday is just round the corner
And my girlfriends asked me what I want
Only thing I can think of is your time
You're the guy at the coffee shop
You're the guy with a puppy in hand
I've seen you everywhere
Almost strange that I'm not in your arms yet

Try me out, try try me out
Let me show you what I've got
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Try me out, try try me out
Hey, why don't we just give it a try

My photos in chronological order
kinda sick of looking at
Only thing I won't be sick of is your face
I'm the glrl at the swimming pool
I'm the girl with a butterfly tattoo
You've seen me everywhere
Almost strange that you don't know my name yet

Can you handle a granola girl like me?
What do you dance to?
What gives you a kick?
Do you find it fun to chill in bed all day?
Tell me if you ever pictured me
Since you just said “Bless you” to me now

Try me out, try try me out
Let's get to know each other tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Try me out, try try me out
Hey, why don't we just give it a try
Oh-oh

Try me out, try try me out
Let me show you what I've got
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Try me out, try try me out
Hey, why don't we just give it a try

Am I any different from other giris?
What's the chance of me winning you?
Cinderella is allowed to dream all day
Hope you will be there
when I blow off candle
I'll save the last song, the last dance

Try me out, try try me out
Let me show you what I've got
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Try me out, try try me out
Hey, why don't we just give it a try

Try me out, try try me out
Let's get to know each other tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Try me out, try try me out
Hey, why don't we just give it a try
Oh-oh

It looked so sweet, it was just a fantasy
A bite will do good to, know that this is real
Somebody tell me, wandering all day
Can you say what this is like?

The sky is blue, why did it have to be so clear?
The day is brighter and my head is getting dim
Fine day, find me, wind it, feel it
What an absurd freedom

Climb up high, jump way high
Let it fall down on this hand, the sweet scent of you
Banned lies, search of myself
To the left, to the right
Rolling Apple Hills

Time will set you free so don`t shed a tear
Tomorrow`s all the way, it`s all yours to live
Free way, don`t hesitate, hesitate, hesitate
Still wandering in your dreams…

Raise your voice, reach to the sun
If you know the right and wrongs, you know what to do
Loosened hand`s loser`s take
Stand up still, behind your will
Rolling Apple Hills

Rolling and tumbling looking for the ending
Longing for breaking the padlock of this wall
Don't you feel it's stifling I can see you staggering , shivering,
silly billy it's sickening
Something must be burning the smoke is
Toxic find your way to exit.  That's it!
She sells sea shells on the she shore
If you don't spit never gonna learn what's it.
It's not the s'il voux plai't.
It's you!  Holding the Keys!

Climb up high, jump way high
Let it fall down on this hand, the sweet scent of you
Banned lies, search of myself
To the left, to the right
Rolling Apple Hills

Raise your voice, reach to the sun
If you know the right and wrongs, you know what to do
Loosened hand`s loser`s take
Stand up still, behind your will
Rolling Apple Hills

Lalalala…Here`s kiss, awake your fist, your sun is gonna shine
Lalalala…I am here, remember dear (It`s) The best day to dream!

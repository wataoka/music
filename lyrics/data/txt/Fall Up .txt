I wanna be somebody, see inside me
sometimes have my love beside me
do it now , and do it right
how about it now
I wanna live my life in books or movies
keep on dancing groovy groovy
try my hardest nothing to it
look me hands free wow
wanna slip trip stumble and fall into love
ones those mushy gushy songs are made of
but one thing stays the same
in the end its gotta change we

and I know that it hurts ya,
but failure builds our future
don't move away
were moving towards today cuz...

I wanna dance in the clouds
and swing around I
I wanna fall real hard but when I fall,
We will fall up we are fallin' up

now if its true what the people are saying
一瞬の奇跡 you never see again and
so sleep sleep もうちょっとI'm saying
reality's a little cliche in the end
真っ白の空に just 向けてand you will see
ほんとうの自分にyou and me
2 legs one heartで進めばいい

日向にいるのに
sometimes I feel so lonely
but好きな歌をくちづさむと
lalalalalalala
let's sing a songよ

na na na
振り返りもうしない
進むしかない
na na na na na na
未来と共に

let change everything cuz

この場所こそ僕のスタートライン
つばさなくても飛べるよ let's fly
I wanna dance in the clouds
and swing around I
I wanna fall real hard
but when I fall, we will fall up

I wanna dance in the clouds
and swing around I
I wanna fall real hard
but when I fall, we will fall up
I wanna dance in the clouds
and swing around I
I wanna fall real hard
but when I fall,we will fall up
we are fallin' up

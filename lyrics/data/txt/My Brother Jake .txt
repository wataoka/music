My brother Jake, hat, shades, head in a daze
My brother Jake, have you thought about changin' your ways?
He goes out, he don't have no doubt
He don't have to know what the world's about

My brother Jake, head, down, it's a scrapin' the ground
Jake, stay away, you know you can't always be down
He goes out, he don't have no doubt
He don't have to know what the world's about

I said Jake, now won't you wait
What's got into you
Your candle is burning, the wheels are turning
What you gonna do?

My brother Jake, won't you start again try makin' some friends
Jake, it's not too late to start again by making amends
He goes out, he don't have no doubt
He don't have to know what the world's about

I said Jake, now won't you wait
What's gone wrong with you
Your candle is burning, the wheels are turning
What you gonna do?

Hey, I said Jake, don't you wait
What's gone wrong with you?
Your candle is burning, the wheels of time are turning
What you gonna do? Yeah

I said Jake, Jake, Jake, won't you wait, wait, wait
What's got into you - oh
Your candle is burning, the wheels of time are turning
What you gonna do?

Listen, I'm gonna break you Jake
Because you got what it takes
To give whole lotta people some soul

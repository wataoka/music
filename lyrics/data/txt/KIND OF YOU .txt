Long ago and far away
Nightmare which fall into
election would go dumb
Anytime will be passing joy
I touch leaves
Slip off my finger like tears

This story a kind of you
We walk on sand every time
This story a kind of me
We walk on concrete

Locked up insecure try not to wonder
Dying to let you know
Just a balance has not taken
Charm your arms make my mouth water
Waiting day dream
shoes in my mouth

This story a kind of you
We walk on sand every time
This story a kind of me
We walk on concrete

Four steps root to the spot
Four steps in the shape of love

Your hand is cold but the sunshine within your hold
The world looks so much sweetness
What comes to my mind is the face of changing you

I wish we faded into one
Me and view of the sky
The sky is light grey

I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love,
I fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
But when the grass got a little greener over on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love,
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did

But I've been strong this time baby
And guess what I'm in love, I'm in love!

Free, on my own that's the way I used to be
Ah, but since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me

I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love,
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did

I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did

I fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fell in love

Stay alive the deadly game you play
Burn the torch now to light the way
Stay alive to break down the wall
The time has come to make the final call

Are we standing on the edge of hope
The human race is on its way to destruction
Fire back to bring us back to life
We are the soldiers at the edge of time

マジンカイザー
We are the soldiers of eternity
マジンカイザー
Immortal god machine sets the world free

Stay alive in where the evil dwells
Enter now the seventh gates of hell
The fearless ultimate creation
We come to save you I'm your soul salvation

Are we standing on the edge of hope
The human race is on its way to destruction
Come face to face, eye to eye
We are the soldiers at the edge of time

マジンカイザー
We are the soldiers of eternity
マジンカイザー
Immortal god machine sets the world free
マジンカイザー
We're on the wings of brave and glory
マジンカイザー
We're gonna fly to the end of the sky

マジンカイザー
We are the soldiers of eternity
マジンカイザー
Immortal god machine sets the world free
マジンカイザー
We're on the wings of brave and glory
マジンカイザー
We're gonna fly to the end of the sky

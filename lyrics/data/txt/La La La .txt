Why should I be shy about it
It's all good I'm proud about it
I like you
I reckon I like you
I just wanna shout about it
Show the world that we have found it
I like you
I reckon I like you

In this world
Where we act so strong
And it seems like we don't care
In this world
What are all these things
If there's no one there to share

Hello
Haven't I seen your face before
Did an angel just walk through the door
Got me thinking bout
LA LA LA
Nothing better than - LA LA
It's the way you walk
It's the way you talk
It's the way you carry yourself
Got me thinking bout
LA LA LA
You know I need that - LA LA LA

No I don't care what you did before
Our time is now I'm forever yours
I like you
I reckon I like you
I love the things you wanna do
Stand ten feet tall when you're coming through
I like you
You should know I like you

In this world
Where we act so strong
And it seems like we don't care
In this world
What are all these things
If there's no one there to share

Everything is better
And everything is brighter
Ever since you came around
Ain't nothing like the present
I wanna buy you presents
Cuz you the dopest around
Everything is better
And everything is cooler
Ever since I saw your face
A minute in your presence
Is better than a present
Cuz you the dopest around

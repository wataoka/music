When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my fovorite songs
when they played I'd sing along it made me smile.

Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone but they back again
Just like a long lost friend all the songs I loved so well.

Every sha-la-la-la every Wo-o-wo-o still shines
Every Sing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin' to sing's so fine

When they get to the part where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry just like before
It's yesterday once more

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had makes today seen rather sad
So much has changed.

It was songs of love that I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word those old melodies
Still sound so good to me as they melt the years away

Every sha-la-la-la every Wo-o-wo-o still shines
Every Sing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin' to sing's so fine

All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before it's yesterday once more

Every sha-la-la-la every Wo-o-wo-o still shines
Every Sing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin' to sing's so fine

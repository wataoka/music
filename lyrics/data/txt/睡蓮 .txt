Just like drawn into the darkness.
I sleep with your feeling left my body.
It's not still enough. Tell me someone,
is there any meaning in the world without my love.

I wish this body could cut up.

凍えそうな夜の果てにあなたを重ねて寄り添う
(All too taugh new world.)
消えぬように閉ざさぬように二人は何処へと向かうの
(Like burned to ashes.)
灰になり立ち上がる空はねぇ、いつでも隠せばいい
(Feel like empty hole inside of me.)

これ以上誰にも言えない
(Snuggle up.)
愛しさなどが何処にあるの?
(To your illusion.)
ねぇ、あなたの匂いだけが
(At the place no one really knows.)
沁み込むこの身体を離さないで
(At the place no one really exist.)

The cold wind is blowing outside.
I can't stand this cold without your warmth.
Where I can go with this empty body.
Just memories stay in my heart.

片付き過ぎた部屋からは二人の孤独が聞こえる
(I might left my heart.)

残された感覚が空を燃えるような蒼に染める
(At the place I felt comfortable.)

目を閉じてあなたを想えば
(Snuggle up.)
残酷さも痛みを増すけど
(To your illusion.)
押さえつけないでいて
(At the place no one really knows.)
全てはもう溢れ出してしまった
(At the place no one really exist.)

The room is too big to live without you.
Have no words for the grief inside of me.
Can't resist my desire of this love.
Have no words for the pain inside of me.

泥沼にただ咲き誇る蓮の花が羨ましい
(Feel like empty hole inside of me.)

これ以上誰にも言えない
(Snuggle up.)
愛しさなどが何処にあるの?
(To your illusion.)
ねぇ、どうか離さぬように
(At the place no one really knows.)
きしむこの身体を忘れないで
(At the place no one really exist.)
これ以上誰にも言えない
(Snuggle up.)
愛しさなどが何処にあるの?
(To your illusion.)
ねぇ、あなたの匂いだけが
(At the place no one really knows.)
沁み込むこの身体を離さないで
(At the place no one really exist.)

The cold wind is blowing outside.
I can't stand this cold without your warmth.
Where I can go with this empty body.
Just memories stay in my heart.

Just like drawn into the darkness.

I sleep with your feeling left my body.
It's not still enough. Tell me someone,
Is there any meaning in the world without my love.
I wish this body could cut up.

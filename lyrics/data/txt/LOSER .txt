I'm a loser
I wanted to be back without any hurt
(I'm just lost today!!)

There's no place for me, already and after all
I'm rambling
(to fight!!)
Like the scenery is changing and changing, my mind do so

Not bind too much, it hurt me and the others
I feel good when I am released
It's freedom!

You'll find the most and the best when you lost it
So just lose it, and sharpen it!

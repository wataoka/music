What did I do with yesterday
How did I let it fade away
I'm weaking up, I'm falling down
Can't catch my breath, I hit the ground

I tried to walk away, but I lost my feet
I tried to say goodbye, but I just can't speak
Can't look you in the eye, and say I'm done
I just won't give you up,
I can't move on

I'm falling down
You're all that I can see
I'm falling down
And I'm empty
God only knows, how far I'll go
When I'm falling down

Lost in the fog, I slipped away
All my regrets, are here to stay
I'm breaking up, I'm falling down
I'm screaming out, without a sound

I'm falling down
You're all that I can see
I'm falling down

I tried to walk away
But I lost my feet
I tried to say goodbye
But I just can't speak
Can't look you in the eye
And say I'm done
I just won't give you up
I can't move on

I tried to walk away
But I lost my feet
I tried to say goodbye
But I just can't speak

I'm falling down
You're all that I can see
I'm falling down
And I'm empty
I'm falling down
You're all that's left of me
I'm falling down
And I'm empty
God only knows, how far I'll go.

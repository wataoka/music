Jump to the sea of crowd
The brighter future in our hands
Dive to the sea of sound
The brighter future in our hands

手取ってWe unite ねぇ踊ってFree your mind
さあ立ってNo loud music, No life
Go way kids Feel more high飛んで行けPeople dive
明日だってNo loud music, No life

This song is for all the divers

肩貸してBe all right 渡らせてFree your mind
さあ立ってNo loud music, No life
集合だWe alive急降下People dive
明日だってNo loud music, No life

This song is for all the divers

Can feel more Won't be long
Jumpin' now for divers area
This song is divers area

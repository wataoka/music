bright memories that became cold as ice
just a past, but my pain is not fake
only loved one gave me a loneliness
finally, now I'm with your shade

theere is no place for us
we've lost the way from very first
we just happened to be there
I know
please send it to the past
and keep it to your heart

give me a time
then I will go

I'm still waiting for you
why? feel like everything's vanished
a long time ago,
we used to cherish the precious treasure days
I'm still waiting for you
can't reach for the thousand of diamonds
star map is here. but you're gone
isn't it real?
embrace me again

defying the rotation of the earth
cause I don't want to move on forward
frozen sky reminds me of scars and pain
go abead, my poor little shame

I tried to practice saying it
along with the real smile
but unforgivable forever
'how are you doing baby?'
maybe lie, too beautiful
as the moment we first met

I'm still waiting for you
then I realize this again and again
I hate you it means I love you
and miss you so much. you should know
I'm still waiting for you
a map won't be seen any longer
the equator separates us
calling to see
opposite far away

last of our atlas
can you feel the destiny?
how alive you now
you waiting for me now?
forever, your place is a here...

on my own
can I redo it? and can I survive?
even a constellation doesn't appear
over dim glass sky
I'm still waiting for you
from the night when I lost everything
I'm here, with protecting the broken love

I'm still waiting for you
why? feel like everything's uanished
a long time ago,
we used to cherish the precious treasure days
I'm still waiting for you
can't reach for the thousand of diamonds
star map is here. but you're gone
isn't it real?
embrace me again

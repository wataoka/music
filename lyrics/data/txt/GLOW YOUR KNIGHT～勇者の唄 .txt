You love and then you hate
You give but then debate
The knight that wonders in tonight salute you
Ich war in dir- The mind from different kinds
So reading down to see your heart 

To see and then your free
Its to me its honesty
He fights in our world to meet to greet you
Von mir bis dir- Beleive but don't deceive
So make the will to start (oh) 

Stay clear, wipe off your tear
A message from your heart
To love and be strong
And to fight, right, tight
But hold your heart
No ordinary world can be so far 

Your Great, Great, Great
In the world of colorgraphy
The knight of monopoly
To recue your heart
Great, Great, Great!
He's the legend of the world we see
You need to glow
Just tell the world you know 

Rain clouds that float by sinf
Nocturnes of lullaby beside me
I won't go crying for
Bearing off yesterday inside me
Somehow I'll find the place
Ordinary world outside me 

To live and then you die
To fly up in the sky
A pyramid of crystals trans so high and
Ich war dir- Dreams can amplify
So choice each will apart (oh) 

Stay clear, wipe off your tear
A message from the heart
To love and be strong
And to fight, right, tight
But hold your heart
No ordinary world can be so far 

Your Great, Great, Great
In the world of colorgraphy
The knight of monopoly
To recue your heart
(suge suge suge)
He's the legend of the world we see
You need to glow
Just tell the world you know 

Your Great, Great, Great
In the world our ordinary world
The knight of monopoly
To recue your heart
(suge suge suge)
In the great world our ordinary world
You feel it's real
Somehow you'll find the place 

And survive!

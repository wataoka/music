workers on strike and marching down the street
the broken bridge won't be repaired today
do what you like I don't mind
the fact is now I need a place to stay

you never know what is gonna happen tomorrow
if time hurries on then you can just pass me by
I ride my bike into dark

fooling around in the photograph
the shifting sands in the speed of your life
no matter how long it takes I'll be fine
draw your own map and go on your way

you never know what is gonna happen tomorrow
if time hurries on then you can just pass me by
no more lights on the street

You look like a foreigner.
The blaze of cheerless eyes.
You seem to want to
return somewhere.
You're also reticent today.

Did you have a nickname?
I imagine this and that.
I want you to tell that to me.
I'd like to call by its name.

How long does she know me?
If that's same, it's good.
How long do I know true you?

You look like a foreigner.
The shyness like a child.
You sing the song I don't know.
The all is special and nice.

How long does she know me?
If that's same, it's good.
How long do I know true you?

What time do you sleep?
Do you like a walk?
I'd like to know about
you more than now.

How long does she know me?
If that's same, it's good.
How long do I know her?
Do I know her deep grief?

How long does she know me?
If that's same, it's good.
How long do I know true you?

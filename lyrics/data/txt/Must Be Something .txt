Sometimes it gets so hard without you
It seems to me the whole world's away
Do you know that you have a clue
Why I was born to live this windy day?
See the clouds spin around tonight
In the darkening sky as if it's alive
And I think of you, oh, you holding me tight
Now feel your warmth revive…

It must be something
That comes, flooding into my heart
There must be something
That leads me through the space between.
It seems so far away
We've come, but it's only a start
Tonight for you I pray
To the brightest star on the heavenly screen…

This time I hope you won't be brave
Oh, please don't sail out to the stormy sea
No more flowers for a hero's grave
But only grass will hide it all in green.
I saw you hurt in my dream
I saw you bleed and I'm awake
I think I heard somebody scream
Right through my heart with an ache…

It must be something
That comes, flooding into my heart
There must be something
That leads me through the space between.
It seems so far away
We've come, but it's only a start
Tonight for you I pray
To the brightest star on the heavenly screen…

It must be something
That comes, flooding into my heart
There must be something
That leads me through the space between.

It must be something
That comes, flooding into my heart

It must be something
It must be something

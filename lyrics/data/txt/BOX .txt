FOR YOU SIMPLE RENDEZVOUS, AIN'T ALWAYS SO.
NOT BREAKING UP IN YOUR MIND, AIN'T ALWAYS SO.
STUCK FAST IN YOUR HEAD, EASY EVEN HARD, AIN'T ALWAYS SO.

WHAT'YA WANNA THINK IS TRUST, AIN'T ALWAYS SO.
WHAT'YA WANNA THINK IS SMOOTH, AIN'T ALWAYS SO.
THOSE SET WAYS BEHIND YOUR WATCHIN' EYES, AIN'T ALWAYS SO.

IF YOU SEEK THAT FUTURE SUFFERING.
YOU MIGHT SEE THE FUTURE IN THE SUFFERING.
IT SPEEDS ME UP BUT THE ANSWER WILL EXIT IN THERE.

IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF SEEKIN' SOMETHING.
YOU WILL KNOW IT WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.
YOU WILL KNOW THE VIRTUE OF SENSE WHEN IT COMES TO EXISTENCE.

(対訳)
BOX

出合を求めず 別れを拒まず
簡単を探さず 難解を恐れず

信頼と固めず 適度と決めず
不変と思わず 傍観と説かず

先に苦悩を求めたなら
苦悩の中に先が見える

倦ねる学びを恐れたなら
震える自分を知れば良い

Yeah! There comes a time when the north becomes the south.
Yeah! It's a long December.
Everybody wants to “chill” a bit, what's this about?
No! No! We're hoping it gets better.
Where's the snowman you're always building with your friends?
This world is heating up like ember.
I want to see it all falling out and about.

1.2.3 wishing I could see something
Fall through my window like it used to be.
Those good days have gone and passed.
Once or twice do you remember
We were making snow angels?
But those days have gone and passed.
Yeah time is heating up. Oh no...

What do you mean when you say I have to stay?
This world is heating up, the degrees are climbing day by day.
I don't think that we have really too much time.
We've been making changes lately,
I know its gonna be alright.

Hey did ya see the signs?
Living your life as if you'll be alright now.
I know I am missing something in the news.
Man we gotta change it!
Hey the signs. Living your life.
But when it comes, I'll be feeling fine.
I know its hard, you know its hard.
Just take your time and go!

These days I am feeling that I'm letting you down.
But ya know, I found the seed inside of me,
And I'm ready to make it grow.
You know your heart must be heating up inside.
It's the same as outside. Maybe it's time to cool it down.

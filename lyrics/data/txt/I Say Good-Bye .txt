I have been thinking of you
Don't know how long time has passed by
I wonder you would disappear
If I gave up missing you

Nothing answers me
It just keeps on raining endlessly
I don't know, mmh...

How can I live without,
How can I live without,
How can I live without you?
'Cause I still love you, evermore

What can I do for you,
What can I do for you,
I can do nothing for you
If only I could say good-bye

Nobody shows what went wrong
Don't know how come you took someone else
I am looking for the right way
Won't you tell me where to go?

No one made mistakes
I just feel you crying somewhere in this rain
I don't know, mmh...

How could you stay by my,
How could you stay by my,
How could you stay by my side?
'Cause you don't love me any more

What can I do for you,
What can I do for you,
I can do nothing for you
That is why I will say good-bye

No matter what you feel I have to say
No matter how much I'm broken myself
Rain will get harder and wash all away...

Just this word can prove my loving from my heart

How can I live without,
How can I live without,
How can I live without you?
'Cause I still love you, evermore

What can I do for you,
What can I do for you,
I can do nothing for you
If only I could say good-bye

How could you stay by my,
How could you stay by my,
How could you stay by my side?
'Cause you don't love me any more

What can I do for you,
What can I do for you,
I can do nothing for you
That is why I will say good-bye

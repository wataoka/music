Waitin' for you my woman,
on the corner of Chinatown lane.
What is it that you're doin'?
Are you trying to keep me at bay?

'Cause it's been a long time.
When are you gonna be just mine?
Here I am alone.
And I wish you would stop all the tricks that you turn.

Waitin' too long for you now.
'Cause I feel like I'm standing in line.
I've been there before, remember?
When I met you the very first time.

Makin' love, red light on.
Somehow you more than turned me on.
Crazy me, all wrong.
And the price that I paid was much more than I gave.

Red light girl, took my money.
Then she broke my heart in two.
And I don't know why I wait for that lady.
Someday for me she'll change her ways.

Waitin' for you till morning.
Am I crazy or out of my mind?
I should have heard the warning

So that's all, I'm mad.

Then she broke my heart in two.
And I don't know why I wait for that lady.
Someday for me she'll change her ways.

Red light girl, took my money.
Then she broke my heart in two.
And I don't know why I wait for that lady.
Maybe it's time to say bye bye bye.

Red light girl, took my money.
Then she broke my heart in two.
And I don't know why I wait for that lady.
Someday for me she'll change her ways.

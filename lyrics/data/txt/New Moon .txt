Time with you
Still makes my day
Just wanted you to know
We went the distance
And now we're home 
How sweetly dreams reappear 
As people grow

So here we are
A whole world to share
This life with you
Moments to remember

Please take me there
I'll walk with you
You know, I'd go anywhere
Think you understand the way I feel

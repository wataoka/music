I've walked so long I can't remember-Where was my home?
Their distant faces fade away I'm always on my own
I can show a smile,it's not hard to do
I can have the strength to go on
But sometimes I wanna let go of everything

When thoughtfulness is not their game I teach by giving love
High mountains seem higher endlessly when they're pebbles at your feet
And if you should still fall into despair,there is one thing left to believe
I lie in your heart always

nothing is braver than honesty,my life is your faith in me

I'll be there when you need
You don't have to hide from me
what you are feeling now
I fill your soul

We will seek together destiny
Troubles have an end
We will carry on hand in hand
You're not alone

People searching desperately outside themselves,
Caught up in thinking of what never helped
And I'd forgotten too that love exists inside of me as in
those that I wanted from-
I feel you now

I'll be there when you need
We will live together
Nothing is in our way
with trust in our soul

We will seek together destiny
Troubles have an end
We will carry on hand in hand
We won't forget we have eachother

Love is in the hearts of all man
You're not alone

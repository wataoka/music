HERE'S TO ALL OF YOU,THE ONES WHO FEEL
THAT THINGS WE CANNOT TOUCH,SOMETIMES CAN BE REAL
AND WHEN WE CLOSE OUR EYES,WE ARE AWAKE AT LAST
TO PAINT A BRIGHTER WORLD THAN WHAT WE HAVE

MAYBE YOU'RE LIKE ME,WITH EYES TO SEE
BEYOND THE CLOUDS OF GREY, POSSIBILITY
OF RAINBOWS IN THE SKY,AND GRACEFUL BIRDS IN FLIGHT
WHERE EVERY HEART IS OPEN TO THE LIGHT

BEAUTIFUL,I MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL
TURNING TO MY SOURSE OF INSPIRATION
PLAYING WITH THE COLORS OF CREATION

WHEN I'M RESTLESS IN THE NIGHT
I CALL MY ANGEL OF THE LIGHT
AND SOON I FEEL HER LOVE SURROUNDING ME
BATHES ME IN MORNING SUN
SHE MAKES ME SMILE AT EVERYONE I SEE
MY UNIVERSE IS BRIGHT
I OWE IT ALL TO HER, MY ANGEL OF THE LIGHT

FLOWERS BLOOM IN MAY,THEN FADE AWAY
AND WINTER BRINGS THE WHITE,SOON ITS OUT OF SIGHT
BUT I CAN STOP THE TIME,AND CAPTURE GOD'S DESIGN
LOOKING THROUGH THIS LENS I MAKE IT MINE

BEAUTIFUL,MY WORK IS BEAUTIFUL
TAKING FROM THE SILVER DREAMS THAT GUIDE ME
PICTURES OF THE WORLD THE WAY IT COULD BE

WHEN I'M LOST AND ALL ALONE
I NEED A STAR TO GUIDE ME HOME
MY ANGEL COMES TO SHINE HER LIGHT ON ME
SHE TELLS ME THAT MY HOPES AND DREAMS
ARE NOT AS CRAZY AS THEY SEEM TO BE
I'M ON MY KNEES TONIGHT
I OWE IT ALL TO HER,MY ANGEL OF THE LIGHT

BATHES ME IN MORNING SUN
SHE MAKES ME SMILE AT EVERYONE I SEE
MY UNIVERSE IS BRIGHT
I OWE IT ALL TO HER,MY ANGEL OF THE LIGHT
ALL TO HER,MY ANGEL OF THE LIGHT

Shall I tell you a story
A story of a poor little boy
A little boy who met a little girl
with a thousand smiles

He named each one of her smiles
He filled his room with her pictures
When she left there was nothing
left but a thousand smiles

He held her tightly the last minute before goodbye
This is what he whispered

“There's nothing I will forget nothing I won't forgive
I never thought I'd come to this
Can't you see Nothing I can regret Nothing I won't miss
but I can hide it for now
'cause you gave me a thousand ways to smile”

It occurred a dozen years later
The next day was his 23rd birthday
His idle life ended up in shooting a girl

He cursed his whole lost life
in a tiny concrete cage
He looked around and found
there's nothing left in his hands

He held himself tightly the last minute before goodbye
This is what he whispered

“There's nothing I will forget nothing I won't forgive
I never thought I'd come to this
Can't you see Nothing I can regret Nothing I won't miss
but I can hide it for now
'cause you gave me a thousand ways to smile”


He held himself tightly in front of the gallows
This is what he whispered

“Nothing I will forget Nothing
I won't forgive I never thought
I'd come to this Can't you see
Nothing I can regret Nothing I won't miss
but I can hide it for now
'cause you gave me a thousand ways to smil”

“Nothing I will forget nothing
I won't forgive I never thought
I'd come to this Can't you see
Nothing I can regret Nothing I won't miss
but I can hide it for now
'cause you gave me a thousand ways to smile so I'm alright”

EVERYNIGHT I LOOK TO THE SKIES AND WONDER WHAT WE DID
ALWAYS A NAIVE POINT OF VIEW THAT BREAKS US IN THE END
IF I COULD FIND THE MEANING OF IT ALL I'D TAKE THE CHANCE
MAYBE IN TIME WE'LL WALK THE MILE AND CHANGE IT IF WE CAN

IT'S NOW AND ALWAYS
HOW DID WE GET THIS FAR
ALWAYS...WE'RE MAKING A BRAND NEW START
ALWAYS...NOTHING WILL HOLD ME DOWN
ALWAYS...WAVE GOODBYE TO ME!

AROUND THE WORLD
I'LL FIND OUT WHY WE CAME TO BE
AROUND THE WORLD
THE SECRET LIES INSIDE OF HE
AROUND THE WORLD
I'LL FIND THE HERO INSIDE ME
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE IF IT'S NO OK!
I'LL CHANGE THAT WORLD
INTO SOMETHING BETTER HONEY!

NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE TAKE OUR TIME AT SEARCHING FOR THE CLUES
ALL WE CAN FIND ARE SITUATIONS HARD TIMES TO GET THROUGH
BUT WHEN WE SIDE TOGETHER NOTHING CAN GET IN OUR WAY
USING OUR MIGHT TO FIGHT THE ODDS NOW WATCH ME SAVE THE DAY

IT'S NOW AND ALWAYS
HOW DID WE GET THIS FAR
ALWAYS...WE'RE MAKING A BRAND NEW START
ALWAYS...NOTHING WILL HOLD ME DOWN
ALWAYS...WAVE GOODBYE TO ME!

AROUND THE WORLD
I'LL FIND OUT WHY WE CAME TO BE
AROUND THE WORLD
THE SECRET LIES INSIDE OF HE
AROUND THE WORLD
I'LL FIND THE HERO INSIDE ME
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE IF IT'S NO OK!
YEAH!

AND YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE RAINING
AND YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HARD
AS LONG AS WE TRUST EACH OTHER
NOTHING'S GONNA BREAK APART OH NO!NO!
IF YA WANNA BE SOMEBODY
GET UP ON YA FEET AND GO
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA MEET EACH OTHER
SOMEWHERE ALL AROUND THE GLOBE

AROUND THE WORLD
I'LL FIND OUT WHY WE CAME TO BE
AROUND THE WORLD
THE SECRET LIES INSIDE OF HE
AROUND THE WORLD
I'LL FIND THE HERO INSIDE ME
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE IF IT'S NO OK!
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE IF IT'S NO OK!
I'LL CHANGE THAT WORLD
INTO SOMETHING BETTER HONEY!

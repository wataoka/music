Come on come on come on
Baby, baby, after you

I dream, I sing a song
when you are inside to drive me
crazy, lazy, daisy

There's such a beautiful place
somewhere over the rainbow
I feel like an angel
Who has seen the top of the world

Come on come on come on
Baby, baby, after you

I've been tried and failed
You are the champion to take me
higher, fire, Gaea

I don't want to give up showing you
Oh, what I fuckin saw
Look baby, I want to keep rocking on you
under my control

There's such a beautiful place
somewhere over the rainbow
We feel like angels
who have seen the top of the world

We'll be there

Come give me the poison
Come give me attention
An emptiness I feel

I work for an angel
I looked for a savior
by emptiness I bleed

As a curse I've been deceived
Like a fool I would believe

As a curse I've been deceived
Like a fool I would believe

I'm missing all the feelings
Everything is lost
As I slowly fade away inside myself
I don't know where to go
Don't know where to go

It's a deadly work
and a deadly look
and I will never crack a smile
as long as I'll be here for this deadly work

It's a deadly work
and a deadly look
and I will never crack a smile
as long as I'll be here for this deadly work

Come give me the poison
Come give me attention
An emptiness I feel

As a curse I've been deceived
Like a fool I would believe

As a curse I've been deceived
Like a fool I would believe

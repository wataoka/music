You have to live free, let's sing a song
I dyed my hair blonde
My friends said“you don't look good”
but I think something changed I wanna Discover it
Around people look at me strange, but it isn't great thing
Don't judge people by looks!
The precious thing is in the heart

Go my way! Go my way!
Go my way! Go my way!
You have to live free,
let's sing a song yeah yeah
(You have to live free,)
let's sing a song yeah yeah yeah...

Take care of everyday day by day!

Go my way! Go my way!
Go my way! Go my way!
I am Golden Head!! (You have to live free)
let's sing a song yeah yeah
(You have to live free,)
let's sing a song yeah yeah yeah...

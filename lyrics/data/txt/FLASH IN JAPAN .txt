Did we learn a lesson
Have we found the cure
Has everyone here seen the light

It came down like thunder
And changed the world
Lit up the skyline
And melted their sight

No war is over 'Til someone gives in

They said folds of the people
Blow down their towers
Know where the enemy hides

The brother and sisters
Crawled through the flames
Never to reach the outside

Is that fire in the sky
Is it war or thunder
Or is it just another flash in Japan

Is there heat in this rain
Will this be the end
Or is it just another flash in Japan

What will we tell them
Say“Listen children,
We blew this all up
Now you start again”

Morning is night now
And night it's winter
Some things have changed
But always remember

That no war is over 'Til someone gives in

Is that fire in the sky
Is it war or thunder
Or is it just another flash in Japan

Is there heat in this rain
Will this be the end
Or is it just another flash in Japan

Is that fire in the sky
Is it war or thunder
Or is it just another flash in Japan

Is there heat in this rain
Will this be the end
Or is it just another flash in Japan

Is that fire in the sky
Is it war or thunder
Or is it just another flash in Japan

Is there heat in this rain
Will this be the end
Or is it just another flash in Japan

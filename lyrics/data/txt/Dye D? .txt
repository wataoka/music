I just can not tell how to love you.
But I know that I need you now. So trust me.

You don't even know how to love me.
Cause you've got know who on earth I am.

I just can not tell what should I do.
So I'm wandering through every night alone.

You don't even know what I'm doing.
But I'm fallin' in forbidden love with you.

嗚呼、当夜も想い彷徨って
狂恋の果てに血迷って
冒涜し身体汚れて
Down Down Down(Down)
闇夜に響く叫声
独り善がりの恋(Love) to (you)
wallow wallow wallow …ow (yeah)

I'll live with you.
Love you tonight.
Whenever you are lost,
I'll be there for you. Never let you go.

I just can not tell how to love you.
But I know that I need you now. So trust me.

嗚呼、汚れなきこの当夜に
選ばれしきみ全人
狂恋の果てにいざなって
Bounce Bounce Bounce (Bounce)
Does tonight make you happy? or sad? or make you cry?
Welcome to the Board of dark moonlight night.

I'll live with you.
Love you tonight.
Whenever you are lost,
I'll be there for you. Never let you go.

I just can not tell how to love you.
You don't even know how to love me.
I did not know what… what should I've done.
But I'm fallin' in forbidden love with you.

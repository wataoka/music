Unknown soldier lying on the floor
Explosions forever
Now you take me away from danger
We had always covered up your face
Out there who will watch your back?
Because I don't know if I can stay here

Game over
Now we hate our brothers
No longer can move my feet

But it's 
Keep on keeping on
And it's I just wanna know
Inside it's I don't want to know
Over head they fly high it's going
On and on and on
Will we oversee the smile of love and peace for everyone?
You can be sure
I'll be back again

Broken window glass is everywhere
Explosions forever
Now you save me from oblivion
We had always covered up your face
Out there who will watch your back?
Because I don't know If I can stay here

Game over
Now we hate our brothers
No longer can move my feet

But it's 
Keep on keeping on
And it's I just wanna know
Inside it's I don't want to know
Over head they fly high it's going
On and on and on
Will we oversee the smile of love and peace for everyone?
You can be sure
I'll be back again

And I remember a long time ago
I will be there for you and please wait for me
Oh you must believe me
Better you believe your mind

But it's 
Keep on keeping on
And it's I just wanna know
Inside it's I don't want to know
Over head they fly high it's going
On and on and on
Will we oversee the smile of love and peace for everyone?
You can be sure
I'll be back again

And I remember a long time ago
I will be there for you and please wait for me
Oh you must believe me
Better you believe your mind

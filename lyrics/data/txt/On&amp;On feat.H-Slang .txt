Think about U baby
Every minute of the day
Whenever down and feeling blue
You came and rescue me
There might be a ups n downs
but our love is here to stay
on & on, on & on, on & on…

Every time I see U, (U) take my heart away
I just don't know how to act coz you're so fly
There's no other who can make me feel this way
Only you can save me, we are meant to be

Whenever you are next to me
Girl I feel the destiny
Hope that you can feel the same way too
Promise I would never leave
Im so sure that I believe
Baby U can make me feel and that is true ooh ooh

Think about U baby

You'z a fly girl, Shine on the spotlight
With your fine clothes on good (Dress tight)
Body so smooth, Silky, I wanna bite
Always thinkin' about You (Damn right)
We can get together and Come on let's celebrate
When you walk by smell sweet like a Chocolate
Lookin' at your pretty face, fallin' in a maze
No way out, let me make your body Shake
On & On & On, Do it all night long
Only Me and You, We can dance to this song
Do it like this, Do it like that
Now you gotta know I'm a YALLA like that

A bedtime story I really love, I need it when I sleep
Every night I sleep very well, 'because my mom reads it for me
Everyone is happy in my dreams, there are flowers of smile bloom
I just hope we have a good day, a peaceful day tomorrow

One night, my mom's changed it a bit, and I didn't like it at all
That made me very insecure, I could not sleep well
I was holding a real gun, in my unhappy dream that night
I didn't want that iron thing, the shining heavy gun

Please mom, do not change it again, don't do that anymore
If you read the story I love, I know I sleep well
So, everyone is smiling again, like they were before in my dreams
I just hope we have a good day, a peaceful day tomorrow

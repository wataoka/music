Give it up Give it up for me
let's get along make my life easy
I said enough said enough indeed
I'm at a loss You out of love for me

Saw you out just yesterday
Calculated play by play
Struck up what you'd call small talk
Held your hand went for a walk
Got the number of your phone
Made a call but no one home
Going crazy waiting alone
Wonder if I can see you again

I'm waiting and wishing

Waking up at eight not noon
In a hurry to see you soon
Brought some flowers to your room
Your mother said you could not see me

You've had it up to here with me
How could you be that busy
She treats me bad but you know I won't
Give it up so easily

Give it up Give it up for me
let's get along make my life easy
I said enough said enough indeed
I'm at a loss You out of love for me

For the love For the love of me
I'll make it all worthwhile you see
Get off Get it up for me
Yeah I want it all

You could've told me yesterday That you never wanted me to play
You gotta get me outa here Gotta figure out what's clear

Give it up Give it up for me
let's get along make my life easy
I said enough said enough indeed
I'm at a loss You out of love for me

For the love For the love of me
I'll make it all worthwhile you see
Get off Get it up for me
Yeah I want it all

In ancient times, all saw the mountains
Ancient people kept watching!
In ancient times, all saw the rivers
The river that runs between us
In ancient times, all saw the seas
Ancient people kept watching!
In ancient times, all saw the skies
The sky that spread out

Don't know what's going to happen to me
Don't know what God wants from me
No need for walking vertically
The way I used to know when I was young

Eternity, I just can't feel the winds
Eternal moment, quit thinking of it!
Eternity, I just can't feel the sun
The sun could never be felt before
Eternity, I just can't feel the air
Eternal moment, quit thinking of it!
Eternity, I just can't feel the dream
I wish I could feel it

Don't know what's going to happen to me
Don't know what God wants from me
No need for walking vertically
The way I used to know when I was young

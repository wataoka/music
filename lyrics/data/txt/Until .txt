Love me till the sky falls down
Love me till the world's not round
O Love me 'just' forever and maybe some more
Just as I have vowed to........

Love you till the seas catch  fire
Love you till the stars expire
I'll love you 'just' forever and maybe some more
Just as you have promissed to........ love me

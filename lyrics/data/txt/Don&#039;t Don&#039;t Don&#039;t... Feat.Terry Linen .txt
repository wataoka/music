Had Thaughts we'd be together
From the first time that I saw you
I hoped I saw the treasure
But I'm still afraid to love you
Will you be kind to me
and be sweet to me
If I give my life to you
Don't stay away from me
Please be there for me
Can't imagine this world without you

Am not the kind a man to make you cry
Am not the kind a man to tell you lies
Together we can make it if we try
True love for you and I
Am gonnabe there for you
The way you be there for me
Let's keep it alive
You are my lover.
I'm your hero
Forever I'll be your light

WHEN WE FIRST ME YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
I STOOD OUT FROM THE CROWD
BUT LATELY DISTANCE BETWEEN US IS GROWING
THE SILENCE SEEMS SO LOUD

I DON'T WANNA HOLD YOU BACK
OR STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR DREAMS
BUT I LOVE YOU SO
I CAN'T LET YOU GO

BUT IF I'M NOT THE ONE
IF YOU DON'T FEEL OUR HEARTS BELONG
IF YOU THINK WE'VE COME UNDONE
THOUGH IT TEARS ME UP INSIDE
JUST LEAVE ME WITH MY PRIDE
AND END WHAT WE'VE BEGUN
IF I'M NOT THE ONE

EVERY TIME YOU IMAGINE FOREVER
IS IT ME THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF
I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU ALL I CAN GIVE
BUT IF MY BEST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH

YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATCH ME CRY
THERE'LL BE NO MORE TEARS AFTER TONIGHT
JUST HOLD ME TIGHT
HELP ME LET YOU GO

BUT IF I'M NOT THE ONE
IF YOU DON'T FEEL OUR HEARTS BELONG
IF YOU THINK WE'VE COME UNDONE
THOUGH IT TEARS ME UP INSIDE
JUST LEAVE ME WITH MY PRIDE
AND END WHAT WE'VE BEGUN
IF I'M NOT THE ONE

I WILL ALWAYS HOLD A PLACE
FOR YOU IN MY HEART
THERE YOU WILL STAY
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU SO
BUT I HAVE TO LET YOU GO

BUT IF I'M NOT THE ONE
IF YOU DON'T FEEL OUR HEARTS BELONG
IF YOU THINK WE'VE COME UNDONE
THOUGH IT TEARS ME UP INSIDE
JUST LEAVE ME WITH MY PRIDE
AND END WHAT WE'VE BEGUN
JUST SAY THE WORD
IF I'M NOT THE ONE

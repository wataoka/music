An obedient moralist against demagogies
I don't know I'm not sure about that
How about group psychology?
Nah, forget that
If you can promise to keep it real, show me your sign
I'm tryin' to walk in a straight line

TOO MANY FACES FADES AWAY
YOU KNOW THA THINGS ARE IN DECAY
TOO MANY FACES BREAKS AWAY
YOU KNOW THA THINGS ARE IN DECAY
TOO MANY FACES FADES AWAY
YOU KNOW THA THINGS ARE IN DECAY
BABY, IT AIN'T HERE TO STAY

&lt;1st verse/Bro.Hi&gt;
肉声…絶える事ない思念のシンジゲート
Emblemは瞬間ごとに変わっていく
God damn! 気づけばWhat we do この狂気緩み切ったGain
保つ正気は行き場失って未だStay here
渦巻いた熱狂 交わす騒がしいだけの社交 感情
その笑顔の裏はNo way out…
もう行くあてもないのに"It's ok fine"
矛盾だらけの逃避それでもいいんだろ?
I know you wanna spend tha time of 忘却
制御不能 未発達なメトロポリス
そう無尽蔵に注ぐ愛情に背を向ける業
どこもかしこも息をしてんだかなんだかのChemicalな奴
語る事さえ止めた瞬間閉ざす"甲乙"
Open'n close 歪み歪んで
つけいる隙だらけでもうお見通し…分かってんだMen!
I know you wanna spend tha time of 虚構

&lt;Hook/Diggy-MO'&gt;
TOO MANY FACES FADES AWAY
YOU KNOW THA THINGS ARE IN DECAY
TOO MANY FACES BREAKS AWAY

TOO MANY FACES FADES AWAY
YOU KNOW THA THINGS ARE IN DECAY
BABY, IT AIN'T HERE TO STAY

NUMB VERMIN IS COMIN' AROUND

ENDLESS GAME OF SOME DELAY
WE'RE G0IN' ON DAY AFTER DAY
SOMEBODY STANDS AT GAZE

WE DON'T NEED KICKS TO FIX
THEY BETRAYED THA SUN

&lt;2st verse/Bro.Hi&gt;
Yeah黙ってねェで言ったらどうだよ?
散々騒いだくせに後の祭りは逃避かよ
なあ…言った筈だWe have no time man
You betrayed…何も分かってねェお前…
探すMainthing逆流する時計なんてある訳なく
流れ流されご覧の通りで…

Damage気づかないふりCan not help
You missing your守るべき精神 Ha?
I know you wanna spend tha time of 忘却
率直なところもどる現実In your area
失ってしまった真実What you want?
全て終わった果て 何が残るかどうか不安気
あげくYou say"何も見ていない"ってまるで犠牲者じみて
今さら"Scary"ってなんだよ
I couldn't help you 'cuz you Betrayed Tha Sun
I know you wanna spend tha time of 虚構

&lt;Inter/Diggy-MO'&gt;
Break it
Your whole world has gone crazy
Take off tha mask
Is it all for somethings or somebody's sake?
Baby, Don't you know tha moods you fake
A loser to your game
Every little move you make is gettin' you away from faith
Everything's goin' to waste

&lt;Hook/Diggy-MO'&gt;

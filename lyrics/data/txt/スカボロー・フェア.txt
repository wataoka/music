Are you going to scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary &amp; thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary &amp; thyme
Without no seams nor needlework
Then shell be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary, &amp; thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then shell be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary &amp; thyme
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then shell be a true love of mine

Are you going to scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary &amp; thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

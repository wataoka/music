someday look back on a young day
we shared we leaned
we had we lost

because... you know
tomorrow had another pain
because we lose
the future is all we have left

one pain one hope
too far so close
we laugh we cry
we live we grow

because... because... we know
the future is all we have left

one day somewhere
hold on some way
we stand willing
we fall we go

because... you know
tomorrow plays another hand
because we lose
the future is all we have left

oh, we have someday
oh, surely someday
oh, surely someday
surely someday

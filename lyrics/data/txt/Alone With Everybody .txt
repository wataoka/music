Where's my dragonfly of past lives?
Where's my lullaby to help me get along?
If you could ever be who you thought you'd be
Would you let me know?
If you could ever see through eternity
Then would you try and help me remember?

And I make it up and I break it up and I let it undo it's theme
I elevate and I levitate and I let it run through it's scenes
While I keep looking on and keep me looking for the one I'm meant to find

Though we don't have the same life
We're all being taken by this rollercoaster ride
Some speed while some move softer and
Adjust to the moment that thry're in

I keep the spirit in a blurry mystique(Alone with everybody)
I leave the body in the ashes beneath(Alone with everybody)
I feel her calling out to me in my oblivion
I kiss the spirit when I need the relief
I heal the body when I feel the disease
And lover, you're the one I search for(Be sad with everybody)

So bring yourself back, loop that and try to figure it out
What you have yet to achieve
But if you fly high all night
You might mistake her for echoes sent through the sky

And I make it up and I break it up and I let it undo it's theme
I elevate and I levitate and let it flow
Beneath the skin you weave
Thsi life was made to be so cynical and sweet

I need to soothe her, feel her
So come into me again and show me who you've been
'Cause I need that feel that we had burning through me again

I keep the spirit in a blurry mystique(Alone with everybody)
I leave the body in the ashes beneath(Alone with everybody)
I feel her calling out to me in my oblivion
I kiss the spirit when I need the relief
I heal the body when I feel the disease
And lover, you're the one I search for

I gotta get you out of here
Before they take you away again
I gotta get you out of here
Before they take you away from me

You multiply, you multiply
But then you die
Don't leave this time
You multiply, you multiply
But then you die
Don't leave

Girl, don't tell me everything is okay
You've been going through and everybody knows
I saw you cry when you looked the other way
You're in a lonely place, and that's not the way it goes
When you got people you care, I'll meet you anywhere to chase your clouds away

I know you do the best you can
But when you need a helping hand
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh
It doesn't matter where you are
You could never be too far
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh

It seems like you got no one to trust
You've been down and out, and they dogged you out,
and now you're so scared(now you're so scared)
You could let go all the pain if you just
Take a Look around, love is to be found, everywhere
You've gotta a whole lot to reap, cuz you helped me when I was weak
And it's my turn now

I know you do the best you can
But when you need a helping hand
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh
It doesn't matter where you are
You could never be too far
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh

I'll be there for my sister
Who you gone call?
I'll be there for my sister
To pick you up when you fall
I'll be there for my sister
Who you gon' call?

I'll be there for my sister
You know you got a friend
I'll be there for my sister,
I'ma ya to the end
I'll be there for my sister
Yes, you know you've got a friend

I know you do the best you can
But when you need a helping hand
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh
It doesn't matter where you are
You could never be too far
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh

I know you do the best you can
But when you need a helping hand
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh
It doesn't matter where you are
You could never be too far
I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister, I'll be there for my sister eh

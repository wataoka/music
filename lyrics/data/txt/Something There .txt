I'm so alone in a crowd and cry
Too many tears
Just like a child who's lost
I became a prisoner of my fears

People come, people go
They are hiding in shadows,
Hiding in dreams

Moving in, moving out
They are nothing but strangers,
Strangers as it seems

My paper heart is so easily torn
Again and again
I never know what the reason may be
It just doesn't end

There's a sound in the air
While the time goes on slipping,
Slipping away

In the air, it is everywhere, 
nowhere, somewhere
So I'm gonna have to say

Why (Is it there)
Tell me why (Is it there)
I don't ever wanna say good-bye (Do you ever wonder why)
As I look into an empty sky
Somebody tell me why (Somebody tell me why)
I feel there may be something there
I feel there may be someone there

Sometimes a ship's gotta break every chain
To go to sea
I'm getting on, I'm getting on,getting on
I want a love to set me free

Take a chance, take a stand
There's a destiny, waiting on a train
And your kiss,it is everywhere, nowhere, 
somewhere
It is warmer than rain

Why (Is it there)
Tell me why (Is it there)
I don't ever wanna say good-bye (Do you ever wonder why)
As I look into an empty sky
Somebody tell me why (Somebody tell me why)
And when I'm wounded in the heart
That's when I play my greatest part

Come on, come on, come on
Cover me tonight
Come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna make it right

You Know that I try, and I try and I try

Why (Tell me now)
Tell me why (Tell me how)
I don't ever wanna say good-bye (Do you ever wonder why)
As I look into an empty sky
Somebody tell me why (Somebody tell me why)

Maybe somewhere (Tell me why)
Maybe someaway (Tell me why)
Gonna find something to set me free (Do you ever wonder why)
I don't know what it's gonna be
Somebody tell me why (Somebody tell me why)

I feel there may be something there
I feel there may be someone there

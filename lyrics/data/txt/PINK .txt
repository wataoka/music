You say, hate me. Please.
All over the world.
I say, bad joke. Bye.
All recorder...You.

予想から 突き抜けて
この胸を 刺すような
理想すら 飛び越えて
知性のむこう

I don't know...Why?
Because, for me to know.
To be pleased to know.
I don't know...Why?
Because, for me to know.
To know, and to laugh it off.

You say, hate me. Please.
All over the world.
I can smile for you.
All remember...You.

空を見る 華のように
蜜を吸う 蝶のように
探してる 求めてる
理性の先で

I don't know...Why?
Because, for me to know.
To be pleased to know.
I don't know...Why?
Because, for me to know.
To know, and to laugh it off.

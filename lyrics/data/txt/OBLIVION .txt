See the brave new world new man
We created with our hands
Watch it slip away
Like a tiny grain of sand
Think of all the sweat and tears
Think of all the wasted years
Does it make you sad
Just to think of all we had

No more time for laughter 
No more time for sorrow
No more morning after
'Cause there's no tomorrow now
We are standing on the edge
Of oblivion

Say goodbye to Avalon
As it fades into the dawn
On the final countdown
To oblivion
Say goodbye to Avalon
As the sacred fires burn
In the end we all return
To oblivion

Have we really come this far
Just to watch it fall apart
Now we face defeat
And it tastes so bittersweet
Bow to the hand of fate
Curse the gods but it's too late
From dust to dust
There is nothing left for us

No more time for courage
No more time for honor
No more time for heroes
This is Armageddon now
We are standing on the edge
Of oblivion

Say goodbye to Avalon
As it fades into the dawn
On the final countdown
To oblivion
Say goodbye to Avalon
As the sacred fires burn
In the end we all return
To oblivion

How soon we'll know the power of prophecy
As we approach the hour of density
There's no way to stop the tide
Nowhere to run and hide from oblivion

Say goodbye to Avalon
As it fades into the dawn
On the final countdown
To oblivion
Say goodbye to Avalon
As the sacred fires burn
In the end we all return
To oblivion

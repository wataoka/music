Yeah...
Baby I'm standing alone
忘れぬ　Rainy day
あなたの影を追って
And it's over　砂のように

I sigh every night
I scream like a child & cried
静かに漂うSorrow
Please Please god　罪を許して

I don't need to hide no more
碧く光るほうへ
流れてく
Just keep going on

☆You've got the chance now
　You've got the power
　気付いてso true yourself
　I show you my life now
　I show you my love now
　I show you everything,yeah yeah
　Baby don't be afraid

Baby I'm lying alone
目覚めぬ　drowning days
終わりの無い　my misery
Now I know that　振り向かない

Life goes round & round
Just silence surrounding me
燃え尽きて　like a phoenix
And I'm falling　奪われていく

I don't need to lie any more
揺れる波の様に
生きればいい
Just keep going on

★You'd better change now
　You'd better catch now
　変わらない　so be yourself
　I'll show you my strength now
　I'll show you my love now
　I'll show you everything,yeah yeah
　Baby don't be afraid

☆repeat
★repeat

Yeah...

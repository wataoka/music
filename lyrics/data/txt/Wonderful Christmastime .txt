The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on,
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong...

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
So lift a glass
Ah, don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all yearlong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on,
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

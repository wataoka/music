And now she wakes to another grey day
In the Big Blue World
And her room's a tiny cage for a golden bird
O where did love go?

And now the baby, that looks like him,
Starts to cry again
And again, again, eternally over again
Do rivers ever end?

Count a thousand drops of rain
Washed down the drain
Is life the same, in a way?

Catch the bus that never comes
Clouds block the sun
Is life the same, in a way?

What will tomorrow bring?
Will birds sing?

And now the flowers in the window box
Seem to bow their heads
As she sits and stares with eyes, sad circles of red
where did love go?

Never a letter or a call
A knock upon the door
So much like life, in a way

Watch the hands move round the clock
Tie time in knots
Life does the same, in a way

What will tomorrow bring?
Will birds sing?

Let the birds sing!

And now she sleeps in an empty bed
Through a starless night
But she dreams of snow-white doves
Bringing branches of love
maybe that's enough

Count a thousand drops of rain
Washed down the drain
Is life the same, in a way?

Catch the bus that never comes
Clouds block the sun
Is life the same, in a way?

Never a letter or a call
A knock upon the door
So much like life, in a way

Watch the hands move round the clock
Tie time in knots
Life does the same, in a way

What will tomorrow bring?
Will birds sing?

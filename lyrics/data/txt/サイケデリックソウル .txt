no time
no long good-bye
no time
no answer for the reason why
no guarantees in life
save for the end
which is no big surprise
time can't be overcome
time won't wait for anyone
the well is running dry
you know, and so am i
i'm sorry now
and then
sometimes i didn't even give a damn
so sorry
yes, i am
to leave the ones who made me a better man
time doesn't understand
'won't let up, it never makes any plans
all stories have to end
"farewell" to all my friends
twilight, free my soul
goodnight... 'time i go
please don't cry for me
please don't be sad
i'll be all right
jus' my turn, you know
please don't be mad
it's part of life
i'll wait there for you
'won't be so bad
we all owe time

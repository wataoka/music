I occasionally remember all that days.
What do you do now? You do it well?
There are times when I only think of myself.
Well, because we are almost over.

Where will be a really important thinking thing?
Sympathizing with everybody is important one?
Although many things were considered, I do not understand well.
How is everybody?

転ぶ後先
ココロの奥
掴んでは消えるよ
揺れる面影
Everybody knows these feelings

When is now though only one's thing is thought about; as for your thing like that!
こおりつくほどの 今旅の途中
When is now though only one's thing is thought about; as for your thing like that!
ため息ばかりで そっと目を閉じる

Why would you leave me all alone to dance?
You know I wouldn't even stand a chance
Among the fancy clowns and grinning princes
I'm trapped inside a lonely masquerade

Inside my head it's spinning round and round
The thought to leave this ball without a sound
You keep an eye on me from far away
Like pulling a puppet on a string

Free ― I'm dying to be free
And I won't wait no more
For I will choose to Be ――
Undoing all the ties
Can't wait to see sunrise

I used to love all of you evil ways
It made me feel like maybe I could change
“You can be anyone you want to be love”
How sweet it sounded in my ear

Free ― I'm ready to be free
And I won't wait no more
For now I choose to Be ――
Undoing all the ties
Can't wait to see sunrise

When this moment stops my heart beat
When the moon is high and over
When the clock has struck the last hand
When the moment's slowly turning

The deadly spell you put me under
Cannot be kept by you deceiver

I will no longer be your dancing doll
Spinning in circles for this tainted ball
To see the truth in you how long I've waited
But now it's past my time to go

Free ― I'm dying to be free
I'm breaking from your chains
For now I choose to Be ――
Undoing all the lies
Can't wait to see sunrise

For now I can be Free ――
Unbind my heart from yours
Undoing all the lies

I'll find the place to Be ――
I'm coming home to me
For all the truth I'll find, all liv inside of me

And now I choose to liv

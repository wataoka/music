I look in your eyes and I can see
You've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart
To anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun

When it's this good
There's no sayin' no
I want you so
I'm ready to go

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever come what may
For a chance of loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help
If you'll only let me try
You touched me
And something in me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready
To kiss that dream goodbye

When it's this sweet
There's no saying no
I need you so
I'm ready to go

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever come what may
For a chance of loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the the wire
Even through the fire

Through the test of time

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever come what may
For a chance of loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the the wire
Even through the fire

To the wire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever

To the wire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever

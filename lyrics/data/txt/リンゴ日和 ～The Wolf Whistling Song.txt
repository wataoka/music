O seven apples on a witch's tree
With seven seeds to plant inside of me
In springtime I grew a magic song
Then skipping along, oh I sang the song to everyone

I looked at the world through apple eyes
And cut myself a slice of sunshine pie
I danced with the peanut butterflies
Till time went and told me to say hello but wave goodbye

A thousand suger stars
Oh put them in a jar
And then whistle round the world
Oh whistle round the world
I'm a little wolf inside a girl, you say
And off I'll go from June to May
Oh whistling round the world

I met a golden swan upon the road
Who was a handsome prince, so I was told
I asked it the way to yesterday
Then I was a sailor, and through the day I sailed away

Bluebird seas I sailed
With mermaids riding whales
Oh whistle round the world
Oh whistle round the world
I'm a little wolf inside a girl, you say
And off I'll go down Wonder Way
Oh whistling round the world

Through apple eyes
Oh there are rose-coloured skylines
Where flying silver spoons
Eat melting marmalade moons

Through apple eyes
I see for millions of miles
The sun's a diamond shining
In the nighttime of a summer day

A thousand suger stars
Oh put them in a jar
And then whistle round the world
Oh whistle round the world
I'm a little wolf inside a girl, you say
And off I'll go（I can not stay）
Oh whistling round the world
Let's whistle round the world
Whistle round the world

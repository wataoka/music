in the cold breeze
that I walk alone
the memories of generation burn within me
been forever
since I've cried the pain of sorrow
I'll live and die the pride that my people gave me

I'm here standing on the edge
and staring up at where a new moon should be
ooohhhhhh

stray
no regret cause I've got nothing to lose
ever stray
so I'm gonna live my life as I choose
until I fall
stray

in the white freeze
never spoke of tears
or opened up to anyone including myself
I would like to
find a way to open to you
been a while, don't know if I remember how to

I'm here waiting on the edge
would I be alright showing myself to you
it's always been so hard to do

stray
no regret cause I've got nothing to lose
ever stray
so I'm gonna live my life as I choose
until I fall
stray

is there a place waiting for me?
somewhere that I belong
or will I always live this way?

always stray
no regret cause I've got nothing to lose
ever stray
so I'm gonna live my life as I choose
cause all things fall
stray

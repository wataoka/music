You are in my arms each night
When I hold my pillow tight
I'm just dreamin' about you
Always dreamin' about you

Though we are so far apart
You are there inside my heart
When I'm dreamin' about you
Always dreamin' about you

Sunny days and ramblin' shoes
Skippin' down the avenues
Happy dreamin' about you
Always dreamin' about you

Why should I be fellin' blue
When these memories of you
Keep me dreamin' about you
Always dreamin' about you

Time after time
You stay on my mind
Life will never be the same
Darlin', till we meet again

Close my eyes, we're together
Oh it's like a dream come true
Close my eyes, I'm in heaven
When I'm dreamin' about you

Mile after mile
You still make me smile
Gazin' at a lover's moon
Do you dream about me, too

Close my eyes, we're together
Oh it's like a dream come true
Close my eyes, I'm in heaven
When I'm dreamin' about you

You are in my arms each night
When I hold my pillow tight
I'm just dreamin' about you
Always dreamin' about you

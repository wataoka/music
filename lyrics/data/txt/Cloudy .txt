Feel like a CLOUD... Meanings are floating.
Feeling in WORD... Leaving my heart.

All tone alive is fade away,
like raindrops away the clouds... endless rain.

Please tell me how to sleep... tonight

Lay down on line, letters wait.
Shape remain to be seen.
I know why Mind lost soundscape.
Leaping birds gone without humming the melody.

Feel like a CLOUD... Meanings are floating.
Feeling in WORD... Leaving my heart.

Hide in the shade, I closed eyes,
like old books that nobody reads.

Feel like a CLOUD... Meanings are floating.
Feeling in WORD... Leaving my heart.

Please tell me how to sleep... tonight.

The thing that light makes the shadow.
The thing that light makes the shadow.

Therefore is must not be too light.

I can see you in the darkness.
I can see you in the darkness.

Before we forget light again.
Before we forget light again.

The tent which dream of what is shining.
The tent which dream of what is shining.

Wait for the Thirteenth moonlight.

I can imagine it slowly.
I can imagine it slowly.

Friday when something changes.

We change tonight...

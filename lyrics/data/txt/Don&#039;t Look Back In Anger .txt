Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Are gonna fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up besides the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cos you aint ever gonna burn my heart out

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late
As were walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
I hear you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

Crystal memories
Touched by your voice, in the moonlight

“Nothing lasts.”you said.
But everything still holds meaning in my heart

Hidden deep in my mind
River to the time
That we once shared together―
the pictures are still on the wall and why.
shining smiles, like snow flakes.
all melted and gone away

Only answer was to live.
and I am still here―
with your memories...

dreaming hopelessly.
holding in my heart
all the flowers you left...

Crystallized moments
Shattered into frozen pieces in my tears

River of moonlight
I hear your voice echoing.
but I'm here, alone...

Crystal melodies
moments so sweet, I remember

“Nothing lasts.”you said.
Then why is pain still confusing memories

Only time will go on
River has its end
Our light was blown by the wind
My fingers reach out and find no one there
Rainy sky, please tell me my emptiness will be filled

Only answer was to live.
and I am still here―
with your memories...

walking hopelessly.
holding in my eyes
all the colors you left...

broken melodies
No more singing, no more laughing in the sun

River of moonshine
I hear your voice echoing
But I'm still alone...

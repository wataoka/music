When the city lights come on in paradise
A special breed of people
Walk the streets at night
Some of them are runaways
Looking for a get away
When the money's good and talk is right they'll play

On a dark and lonely night there was a friend of mine
Who disappeared into that eerie underground
She was just a runaway
Looking for a get away
But she didn't think that world could steal her soul

As the days and months and years went by
She didn't seem to notice time
Then I realized that somehow she had changed

Just a mam, heart in his hand
She's a big teaser
Don't believe in her eyes
Never the same
Nothing would please her
Can't believe in lying eyes

Lookin' down upon you

Never in my life had I seen paradise
A lady I once met said she could take me there
Telling me to come away
Said that we should get away
I could not believe the price she said I would pay

But she asked me if I'd help her change
She didn't want to play that game
Then I realized that she was still the same...

I'm a man. heart in my hand
She's a big teaser
Don't believe in her eyes
Never the same
Nothing would please her
Can't believe in living eyes

I don't know
How I fell for those eyes
Now I'm caught in their trance
Can't escape
I got no chance...

Just a mam, heart in his hand
She's a big teaser
Don't believe in her eyes
Never the same
Nothing would please her

Just a mam, heart in his hand
She's a big teaser
Don't believe in her eyes
Never the same
She's a big teaser

Just a mam, heart in his hand
She's a big teaser
Don't believe in her eyes
Never the same
Nothing would please her

Just a mam, heart in his hand
She's a big teaser
Don't believe in her eyes
Never the same
She's a big teaser

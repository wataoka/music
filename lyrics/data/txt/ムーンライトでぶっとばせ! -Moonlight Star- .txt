Living simple, Let your heart lead the way
Asking nothing, No medicine to apply

Shoot down "Highway Star"
So it's time to go
Shout down "Walk this way"
So it's time to start

When I plug into sky
Yes, I'm the moonlight star

Just wanna rock you
Shock you
Baby, Drive you crazy
Rock you
Shock you
Baby, Drive you crazy

Open the door vibrated with the beat
To your light
I have the sound to play

Plunder "LOVE GUN"
We don't need blank shot
Raise old "BLACK DOG"
Cannot bite at you

When it turn on the night
Yes, I'm the moonlight star

Just wanna rock you
Shock you
Baby, Drive you crazy
Rock you
Shock you
Baby, Drive you crazy

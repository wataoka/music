Such a feeling's coming over me from you.
There is only one wish on my mind.

I long to be close to you.
I long to be close to you.
I'll be on your side. Forever more.

You are a miracle to me, miracle to me.
Let me tell you this.
I don't wanna lose your love, my love.

You are a miracle to me, miracle to me.
Let me tell you this.
But, I can not explain how much I love you.

How can I tell you now?
How can I say to you?
There is only one wish on my mind.

I long to be close to you.
I long to be close to you.
I'll be on your side. Forever more. Forever more.

I don't wanna lose your love, my love.

You are a miracle to me, miracle to me.
Let me tell you this.
But, I can not explain how much I love you.

You are a miracle to me, miracle to me.
Let me tell you this.
I wanna hold you tight tonight, my love.

You are a miracle to me, miracle to me.
Let me tell you this.
But, I can not explain how much I love you.

Such a felling's coming over me from you.

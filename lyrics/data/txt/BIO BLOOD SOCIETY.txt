WHY? TELL ME WHY!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
NOW! TELL ME NOW!
CUZ I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND MYSELF
NEVER! YOU NEVER EVER
GO ACROSS THAT FATAL LINE
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
SOMETHING'S GOING ON...
I'M A CREATURE WHO'S GOT BROKEN GENES
I LOOK LIKE A MONSTER BUT I CAN FEEL
I'M A PSYCHO, WITH NOWHERE TO GO
BUT I'M A FIGHTER, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I'VE LOST MY GlRL, I'VE LOST MY FRIENDS
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING, GOT NOTHIN' A LOSE
THEN, ONE DAY I SAW A PRETTY GlRL
SHE LOVED MY LONELY HEART 'N'
ALL MY TENDERNESS
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME THE FATE OF MY LIFE
IT'S GETTING FASTER...
OUR LIFE CAN BE A ROLLERCOASTER
THAT'S LOST A WHEEL
I CAN NOT FORGET WHAT THAT MEANS
CUZ I'M ALIVE JUST NOT TO GIVE
PEOPLE SAY "YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT!"
PEOPLE SAY "DON'T TRY TO BE DIFFERENT!"
I DON'T WANNA BE JUST LIKE THEM
CUZ I'M INDEPENDENT OF SOCIETY
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME THE FATE OF MY LIFE?

GIMME THE REASON
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
NOW! TELL ME NOW!
CUZ I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND MYSELF
NEVER! YOU NEVER EVER
GO ACROSS THAT FATAL LINE
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
SOMETHING'S GOING ON...

SHE'S THE ONE I BELIEVE IN

HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME THE FATE OF MY LIFE?
I'M JUST WONDERING WHY...
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
NOW! TELL ME NOW!
CUZ I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND MYSELF
NEVER! YOU NEVER EVER
GO ACROSS THAT FATAL LINE
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
SOMETHING'S GOING ON...
GIMME THE REASON
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
NOW! TELL ME NOW!
CUZ I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND MYSELF
NEVER! YOU NEVER EVER
GO ACROSS THAT FATAL LINE
WHY? TELL ME WHY!
SOMETHING'S GOING ON...

THERE'S NO FUTURE, NO WAY!

In my room描くFantasy
つまらない事は無い Honestly
Believe!もしかして叶う夢
妄想にふけて現実超え
How・does・it・feel...
空を眺めゆっくりとChill
Daydream!あても無く旅に出る
足跡をつけて前へ進む
The Sun, The Rain, The Moon, The Stars
自分の信じる道へDepart
Desire..., Makes me feel higher!
どこまででも飛ぶ夢のグライダー
Overflowする前にGo!
次のミッションへと走りに行こう
目を覚まそう, Yeah Hey Hello!
現実の光浴びていこう!

Sometime need this time alone
Freshing out my soul
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream
Sometime need this time alone
Cleaning out my road
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream

I feel the morning breeze
次から次に季節変わり
Sometimes I want to chill
窓の外をゆっくりみてる

Daydreaming俺の時間I can think of what I want
Is it me or inside of me, telling me
There ain't no stopping
Gonna get big with a lot of tricks
Levelをあげてright to the next step
夢はここから全世界へ
響かせたいぜour music so I relax
Take a deep breath
Reminisce of all that I did
頭を空っぽにしてreset
Then I'll start my next trip!

Sometime need this time alone
Freshing out my soul
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream
Sometime need this time alone
Cleaning out my road
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream

I need my space to think
Chilax with my drink
Nothing can bother me
Breathing with nobody
I need to release my stress
So I could dream in my bed
Make my mind free to chill and steel

Sometime need this time alone
Freshing out my soul
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream
Sometime need this time alone
Cleaning out my road
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream

Sometime need this time alone
Freshing out my soul
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream
Sometime need this time alone
Cleaning out my road
Wanna relax from head to feet
I'll be chillin' in da daydream

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew
I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key
To my peace of mine, 'cause

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

When my soul was in the lost a foun
You came a long to claim it
I didn't know
Just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helpd me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Oh what I'm livin' for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more, 'cause

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Oh baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be close to you
You make me feel so alive, baby

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

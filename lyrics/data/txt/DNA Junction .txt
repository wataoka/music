Black, black joke, I only trust my own judgment
I'm a loner
Wanna laugh along with somebody else
But can't lie to me
Had so many chances, chances thrown my way
Ignored them all
Had the opportunity to do it all over
But just couldn't do it

DNA Junction, the future the past
Sometimes it's just easier not to make conversation
DNA Junction, wanna keep laughing
Bursting with excitement starting from today
That won't happen at the drop of a hat

Not that I don't listen to other people
Just can't help it
Don't really want to lie to anybody
They just slip out
Had so many chances, chances thrown my way
I ran every time
Had the opportunity to do it all over
I'll never change

Rather die than be uncool

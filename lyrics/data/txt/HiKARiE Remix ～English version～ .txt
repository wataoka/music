(what do you want to do?)
(what is the meaning of life?)

what you want to be? what you want to do?
whatever you want to be, you can be

where you want to be? where you want to go?
wherever you want to go, you can go

believe in yourself
no matter how far you have to go
don't stop your steps
no matter how hard the winding road will be

I want to be there for you
when you need me near by your side
(I will) always be there for you
love will shine on you

no matter how far I am
nothing can break us apart right now
don't stop your love
my heart will always be with you 'til the end

you are the lonely one, you are the only one
you will be the shining star of my life
I want to brighten up, in the darkest night
I believe in you, believe in yourself

when you want to know? when you want to go?
whenever you want to go, you can go
'cause you may be rich 'cause I may be poor
nothing is gonna change my life, how I feel

believe in love
no matter how high you have to go
don't stop your love
no matter how far the winding road will be

I want to be there for you
when you need me near by your side
(I will) always be there for you
love will shine on you

no matter how far you are
nothing can break us apart right now
don't stop your love
my heart will always be with you 'til the end

no matter how much rain and pain,
no matter how much wear and tear you may have
we are in this together, forever, I will always be there
everything's gonna be alright, nothing's gonna bother us right now
the answer lies in nowhere but inside of our own hearts

I want to be there for you
when you need me near by your side
(I will) always be there for you
love will shine on you

no matter how far I am
nothing can break us apart right now
don't stop your love
my heart will always be with you 'til the end

you are the lonely one, you are the only one
you will be the shining star of my life
I want to brighten up, in the darkest night
I believe in you, believe in yourself

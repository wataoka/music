I was his From the moment We first met
From a solo to duet
It took no time
Call it fate Or just two hearts Magnetized
But I never felt so high Sinse he's been mine
We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love you hold so tight
We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love that lasts a girl for life
With a kiss I can't resist Or turn away
All I want is him to stay It's paradise
Without a word Or nothing heard
We say so much
With a look or silent touch
I know we'll be alright
We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love you hold so tight
We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love that lasts a girl for life

We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love you hold so tight
We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love that lasts a girl for life
We've got a love so pure
Yes, a love so sure
The kind of love you hold so tight for life

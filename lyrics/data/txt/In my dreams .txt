Tonight, just saying goodbye makes me feel
Like we'll be apart forever.
Moonlight casts your shadow in my eyes
Please promise me to come back again.

I don't wanna be alone
'Cause I have already known
How much I've been in Love with you
(And) It's no lie.

Please tell me, why can't live without you?
I don't know how to get over misery

Now I lost in the stream of your love
Just like a mermaid.

I know, there is someone on your mind
But I know, too. It's not me.

I always lose my way
Whenever you are away

Find the key to the mystery of love
(But it) ends in vain

Please tell me, why can't live without you?
I don't know how to get over this pain
Now I lost in the stream of your love
Just like a mermaid.

Please believe in what you see
Give your precious kiss to me
We will find perfect world
maybe someday.

Please do not go
There's no one else but you
I don't know how
to get over such pain

Now, I know I'll see you once again
But only in my dreams

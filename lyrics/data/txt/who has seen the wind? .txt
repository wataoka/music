Who has seen the wind?
Barn swallow in the sky?
Neither I nor you
But when the leaves and flowers hang trembling
The wind is passing throught

Play but one prayer for me, for me
Think but one thought of me up in the stars
The morning light sips
Faint and gray twixt the leaves of the aspen, betwixt the cloud-hars
Pray but one prayer for me twixt thy closed lips

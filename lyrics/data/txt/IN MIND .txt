I hold pain in heart and they're crying
wind blew and take away
before I even knew it

should I do or not
there's no reason
all things shut out to me
don't leave out...

close my eyes feel flow on the time
only when I look in mind
there're no more tears and no more borders in here

close my eyes feel flow on the time
see the sky has no limit
now I'm braking through, wall I made for in mind

racing to the clouds
without stopping
but we're still looking back
and wandering up and down

like countless stars
never ending
love, these always covered
don't leave out

stay with me all memories
only look up good fortune
don't forget the heart of gratitude in my life

stay with me, all memories
when it's changing the future
so I'm braking through, wall I made for in mind

close my eyes feel flow on the time
only look in the mind's eye
there're no more tears and no more borders in here

close my eyes feel flow on the time
see the sky has no limit
now I'm braking through, wall I made for
so I'm braking through, wall I made for in mind

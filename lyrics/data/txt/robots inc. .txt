Here's a call for everyone
Take a chance and love someone
Call me when you need me around
It's over now
Overwhelmed and self assured
Wondering when there'll come a turn
Every chance to change your ways is now begun
So get it done!

You've seen the clues today
We're all wrapped in a box to get shipped away
We see this all the time
But I'll be damned if I let you change my mind
Robots!

Have you ever noticed
They profit from our questions?
Have they got the answers?
Can they save us all?

Take it from the experts
Who have their deal of problems
Clever on the inside
They take it took far

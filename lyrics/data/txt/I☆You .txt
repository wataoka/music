Everytime you smile
And everytime your near
止めれないの My heart beats faster
And everytime I try
But everytime I can't
I just can't stop thinking about you
Baby I☆You

I still remember that one day
The moment I first saw you smile
You filled my heart with butterflies
I've never felt this way before
You probably haven't realized yet
to you I know I'm just a friend
I never knew being close to you
would actually be this hard

And I just can't get you off my mind
考えたくないのに
I just don't know what to do
忘れたいのに

触れそうで 届かないよ
こんなに近くにいるのに
So everytime I try
But everytime I can't
諦めればいいのに

Everytime you smile
And everytime your near
止めれないの My heart beats faster
And everytime I try
But everytime I can't
I just can't stop thinking about you
Baby I☆You

You always talk about that girl
I look at her and look at me
She's everything what I don't have
It's time for me to just move on

And I just can't get you off my mind
考えたくないのに
I just don't know what to do
忘れたいのに

触れそうで 届かないよ
こんなに近くにいるのに
So everytime I try
But everytime I can't
諦めればいいのに

Everytime you smile
And everytime your near
止めれないの My heart beats faster
And everytime I try
But everytime I can't
I just can't stop thinking about you
Baby I☆You

触れそうで 届かないよ
こんなに近くにいるのに
So everytime I try
But everytime I can't
諦めればいいのに

触れそうで 届かないよ
こんなに近くにいるのに
So everytime I try
But everytime I can't
諦めればいいのに

Everytime you smile
And everytime your near
止めれないの My heart beats faster
And everytime I try
But everytime I can't
I just can't stop thinking about you
Baby I☆You

So you're really off now.
I believe you just the way you are.
I can take care of myself.

Wake up! One things for sure.
We are not just spinning our wheels
Everything counts. So It's up to us.

Follow your heart and it will lead you to the right answer.

We get on the LAST ALLAIANNCE AIRLINES
Whoever strike first wins.
We have just found a way.

You're not having to stop, here.
We had to fight very for a long time.
So I'm too excited to wait anymore.
Don't worry.

There's no time like the present.
Today is another day.

We get on the LAST ALLAIANNCE AIRLINES
Whoever strike first wins.
We have just found a way.

I'm here for you. Fly again,
Way up there. Far away!
Once again. Better luck next time!
Stand up, again!
Fight back tears, again.

We don't have to start from scratch.

So I'm just glad to make a last alliance with you.
Thanks for everything.
The climax is from this.
I want to see you again.
Just stay put. Just stay put.
I think we're getting there.
Now, we're on our way.

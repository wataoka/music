Misunderstood girl thinking, Rotation
Get a lot, but only “good”, just serious
Take 3 years waiting, so...
For in a word
Looks like a “Flat” soda, too sweet

(Now) Pushed up the windows to say “Hello” you
Go outside of my door, step into “New”
Walk, Wall read the Head Line is
“Come get it, Now !”
You know what cause
Only by waiting but you get nothing

Let's just go !
From this Everyday to Brighter dayz
Everybody for every soul to fly
There's a time
Let's go where nobody goes!

Jump up the wall
Jump up the wall
Go !!

We bring the beats from the north top
To the city of Tokyo
Nobody can stop us
North to the south, west to the east
City to city we bring やばい beat to the scene
We don't see the 限界
飛べない時の訳は多分 so personal
期待と依頼はまるで違う
愚痴並べ立てても nobody gon help you out
蹴っ飛ばすまっさらな地面から高く jump up
根が深く張り巡らした迷路から get back on the track
Crack するまでcrush flash out するまで fly up the sky
プラスを引き込みマイナス吐き捨てる
ひたすら昇り続ける straight to the top

Let's just go !
From this Everyday to Brighter dayz
Everybody for every soul to fly
There's a time
Let's go where nobody goes!

Let's just go !
From this Everyday to Brighter dayz
Everybody for every soul to fly
There's a time
Let's go where nobody goes!

Jump up the wall
Jump up the wall
Jump up the wall

Ready for the next level of the world
Let's jump up the wall

Let's just go !
From this Everyday to Brighter dayz
Everybody for every soul to fly
There's a time
Let's go where nobody goes!

Let's just go !
From this Everyday to Brighter dayz
Everybody for every soul to fly
There's a time
Let's go where nobody goes!

[Outro] ×8
Jump up the wall
It's the chance to see another world

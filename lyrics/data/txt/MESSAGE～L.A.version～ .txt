Look up at the night sky, I can't …any more.
Just standing on the same bridge as yesterday
All my friends have gone somewhere
It is so far away

But I can make friends anywhere anytime.
Those friends with same broken hearts and dreams
Our rule is "Don't give in complain."
Force a smile but My heart…

I must try to kill the pain forever
Gathering all the broken hearts together
Where we go? What do I want? Tell me someone
If you need me in your life
You give a reason for YOU&amp;ME
why do you look at me with a sad face,
Just I need very simple message.

I'm not serious I don't like politics.
I don't believe in my father and my mother.
Look me in the mirror every time.
But I can't see myself.

I must try to kill the pain forever
Gathering all the broken hearts together
I'm getting away from the darkness and loneliness
If you need me in your life
You give a reason for YOU&amp;ME
I got it again right now, But it is wrong
Just I need now honest message.

Look up at the night sky, I can't …any more.
Just standing on the same bridge as yesterday
Only a charade of love passing by
Is there love? Tell me now.

I must try to kill the pain forever
Gathering all the broken hearts together
I just want true love. Do not want fake love
If you need me in your life
You give a reason for YOU&amp;ME
We are waiting for message forever

I must try to kill the pain forever
Gathering all the broken hearts together
Nobody touches our dream & future
If you need me in your life
You give a reason for YOU&amp;ME
I'll be able to feel your dream & true love
I still believe in you. Just I need very simple message.

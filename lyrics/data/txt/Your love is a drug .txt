When trouble ever gets me down
You're touch is all I need to turn me round
You lift me up
Your love is a drug

When life is just a misery
Your kisses are the only remedy
Can't get enough
Your love is a drug

Knock me off my feet
Make my worries absolete
It's so groovy
Just like a movie

Flyin' through the sky
As I'm jonesin' for those eyes
It's amazing
How you can make a sober girl so high

I used to see the world as dark
Now everyday the sun shines in my heart
You lift me up
Your love is a drug

It's something more than chemistry
I'm trippin' everytime you're next to me
I can't get enough
Your love is a drug

The buzz is oh so strong
Tune me in and turn me on
You're a rainbow
You make my love grow

Take me for a ride
You're my tie dye butterfly
It's amazing
How you can make a sober girl so high

I know I'll never shake the stuff
I'll always be a junkie for your love
I can't get enough
Your love is a drug
It's  more than a puff
Your love is a drug
You lift me up
Like your love is a drug

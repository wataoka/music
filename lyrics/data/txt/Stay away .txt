Stay away  Stay away

I don't know since when I have lost my heart
It should be inside me

Just only god knows where it is
So I'll be like a bird

Close your eyes
Can you see?
Hide and seek
It's you and me

はるか彼方へ
時を超えはばたこう

Stay away  Stay away
Stay away 'couse we don't stop

くだらないメランコリックな世界は
手に入れたものさえ
泡のようで
忘れかけたあの空の向こう側なら
消えないから

Stay away  Stay
away Stay away 'couse we don't stop

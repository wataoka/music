Sitting alone 璧にもたれ Reminiscing...
太陽 falling through 木々の隙間から
And I am so sorry こんなにも溢れてる
甘い香りに気付いてYou're my something
I'll be next to you

Am I getting too close?
I just want you to stay
ずっと一緒だよ and don't go away
You're always here with me
いま愛のうた
両手包み込んで離さないで
その温もりを 変わらずに
And now I'm getting you close to me

迷い込んだ子猫のよう It's embarrassing...
過去も今も未来 everyday
I'm lookin at pictures
あの日はねどんな日だって
蒼くただ so clear
気付いてYou're my something
I'll be next to you

Am I getting too close?
I just want you to stay
ずっと一緒だよ and don't go away
You're always here with me
いま愛のうた
両手包み込んで離さないで
その温もりを 変わらずに
And now I'm getting you close to me

You are the sun You are the rain
You are in my perfect picture
Here I am もうひとつ Can I ask?

Oh, am I getting too close?
I just want you to stay
ずっと一緒だよ and you don't go away
You're always here with me
いま愛のうた
両手包み込んで離さないで
その温もりを 変わらずに
And now I'm getting you close to me
Oh I'll be next to you
Now I'm getting you close to me

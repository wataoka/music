Everyday seems like a brighter day
Whenever I see u walking down my way
People say â€˜it's just another phase'
But nobody's ever made me feel this way

Take me into your arms and I'll be yours, you'll be mine
Baby you know exactly how to make me smile

Like the star in my sky,I need you through the night
your love surrounds me taking me up so high
Something about you boy I can't descride
how good you make me feel inside
Like a star in the sky forever shining bright
I'm thinking of you until the morning light
Something about you boy I can't deny
So lost without you by my side

Everyday feels like a holiday
When you're here beside me troubles drift away
Suddenly everything's so clear to see
All I need is you shining down on me

Take me into your arms and I'll be yours, you'll be mine
Baby you know exactly how to make me smile

Like the star in my sky,I need you through the night
your love surrounds me taking me up so high
Something about you boy I can't descride
how good you make me feel inside
Like a star in the sky forever shining bright
I'm thinking of you until the morning light
Something about you boy I can't deny
So lost without you by my side

Like the star in my sky,I need you through the night
your love surrounds me taking me up so high
Something about you boy I can't descride
how good you make me feel inside
Like a star in the sky forever shining bright
I'm thinking of you until the morning light
Something about you boy I can't deny
So lost without you by my side

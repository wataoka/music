It's time to close your eyes
and lie down by me
I try to say nothing more
If you feel gulity
you can forget what you've done
But don't forget that I'm here

White I was dreamin'
you were running in your head
Who the hell could've
stopped you getting worn out?
Who is to blame? Am I?
Maybe it's too late,or maybe it's not
I asked myself so many times in vain

Hugs,very kind words,lots of kisses
don't work anymore
I don't even know what to do
Do you know the reason why
I can still write and sing a song
Because music is everything to you
and I love you

I'm dreaming
and in my dream,
I see your eyes
They fill my heart
with heaven
I'm flying
and in the sky,
I see your eyes
They answer all
my longing for you
I've always lived
my life in fantasy
No chance to take,
no heart to break
But now you take
my hand and,
you make me understand
that two dreams,
can join together
It's morning
and as I wake,
I see your eyes
They are my reason,
they are my answer now
Because I love you
The one who made
my dreams come true
I've always lived
my life in fantasy
No chance to take,
no heart to break
But now you take
my hand and,
you make me understand
that two dreams,
can join together
It's morning
and as I wake,
I see your eyes
They are my reason,
they are my answer now
Because I love you
The one who made
my dreams come true

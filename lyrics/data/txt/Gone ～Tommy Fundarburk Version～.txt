Gone
My love has gone away
Like the darkest night
I can still hear her say
She would believe in our love
Till the end of time
She couldn't give reasons why
Deep in her heart

She was sure that our love would survive
And now here I cry
In the openness of the sky
I say to her goodbye

I've always been the strongest one
Who could have ever known
She would call my name
But now our love is gone

Gone
My heart has gone away
In the midst of the storm
Can you still hear me pray
Asking for love to return
Show me the way
Will I ever be able to learn
Love doesn't come
No,love doesn't come everyday
My eyes turn to grey
I won't ever be the same
My love has gone away

I've always been the strongest one
Who could have ever known
She would call my name
But now our love is gone

She was sure that our love would survive
even now I cry
In the openness soul the sky

I say to her goodbye

I've always been the strongest one
Who could have ever known
She would call my name
But now my love my soul is gone
She would call my name
But now our love is Gone

Makes me happy when you smile.
You blush right out, stay where you are,
Every move you make is a photograph.
We're taken pictures in the park,
posing just like the movie stars,
I can't see anything out of focus.

I know that you'll be there for me always,
i could take you to a different place you hadn't been before.
Will you walk with me just for a little while?
Got something that I need to say.

If I hold your hand just a little more,
could you smile for me oh baby.
You're the girl I need, and I want nothing more,
would you say the same for me.
If I sing a love song, would it turn you on?
You could be my melody.
I could bring some yellow flowers when I come home to you.

Local car crash on the news.
Call your house, no sign of you.
Agitated from this tension.
The doorbell rings, i'm not looking back,
I fall to my knees can't face the fact.
What am I supposed to do? oh no!

I know that you'll be there for me always.
I'll see you in that other place, wherver it is.
Could you visit me just for a little while?
I got something that i need to say.

If I hold your hand just a little more,
could you smile for me oh baby.
You're the girl I need, and I want nothing more,
would you say the same for me.
If I sing a love song, would it turn you on?
You could be my melody.
I could bring some yellow flowers when I come home to you.

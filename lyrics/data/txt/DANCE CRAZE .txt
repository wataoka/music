Swing if you're in the trees
It is a law of the jungle
Fall in step with me
And take off your high heeled sandals

Move while the music's loud
Hear my motor starting up
Oo we gotta loose this crowd
And make some crazy love

Dance away your troubles
Dance away your worries
Dance away your sorrow
Like there'll never be no tomorrow
Dance craze……

If you don't move
(Your soul) out of the groove
(Don't just) talk the talk
You gotta walk the walk
Dance craze……

Runs away so easy
chances can go away easy
Feel like I'm falling down the stairs
with my dreams behind

Did we pay our life to
Devil to waste our dream
I was just a keen and
wishing to make it true

Oh my Load
Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
Was I just aiming to the dark
why tell me why
Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
But I still believe that I haven't missed
the way to my goal

My mates were easy
We knew we were tighten so hard
A master with bunch of bull shit
put he's ass on my face

Race against my self
That's what I was spose to do
Believe on my self
What I was spose to do

Oh my Load
Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
Was I just aiming to the dark
why tell me why
Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
But I still believe that I haven't missed
the way to my goal

Runs away so easy
chances can go away easy
Feel like I'm falling down the stairs
with my dreams behind

Oh my Load
Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
Was I just aiming to the dark
why tell me why
Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
But I still believe that I haven't missed
the way to my goal

Tell me what I got to do
Tell me what I got to do
But I still believe that I haven't missed
the way to my goal

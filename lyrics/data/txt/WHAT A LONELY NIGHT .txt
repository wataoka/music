(I can't live without you)

In my mind
Thinkin' about you, baby
I've got a crush I'm crazy about you
Tell me that you love me, baby
Please! What a lonely night

Close my eyes
Keep down my feelings
I need you so
I want you so
Tell me that you love me, baby
Please! What a lonely night

(I can't live without you)

I'll tell you my feelings, baby
(So can you feel it?)
I thought I'd never fall
(So can you feel it?)
I can not keep this feeling
(So can you feel it?)
Oh! No no, I want you

In my mind
Thinkin' about you, baby
I've got a crush I'm crazy about you
Tell me that you love me, baby
Please! What a lonely night

(I can't live without you)

I'll tell you my feelings, baby
(So can you feel it?)
I thought I'd never fall
(So can you feel it?)
I can not keep this feeling
(So can you feel it?)
Oh! No no, I want you
And I can not sleep tonight

(I can't live without you)

I'll tell you my feelings, baby
(So can you feel it?)
I thought I'd never fall
(So can you feel it?)
I can not keep this feeling
(So can you feel it?)
Oh! No no, I want you
And I can not sleep tonight

I'll tell you my feelings, baby
(So can you feel it?)
I thought I'd never fall
(So can you feel it?)
I can not keep this feeling

Oh! No no, I want you
And I can not sleep tonight

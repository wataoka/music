i've heard the flap
the bird fly in sun rise
nobody can touch or search it
forever

fallen wing i've kept
is faded and rotten
it's going to be flickering
in your sight

the end of a night
with the dawn
上演の合図が鳴り
with my dream
楽園の幕が開く

現在を遥か超え
轟音の羽ばたきが
with my dream
地上に降り注ぐ

i've heard the song
the bird fly in twilight
nobody can touch or search it
forever

falling from the sky
shiny as a star light
it's going to be flickering
in your sight
the end of a night

with the dawn
上演の合図が鳴り
with my dream
楽園の幕が開く

現在を遥か超え
轟音の羽ばたきが
with my dream
地上に降り注ぐ

whoever you are
where ever you go
過去も 今も 未来へと
絶え間なく

the end of a night
with the dawn
上演の合図が鳴り
with my dream
楽園の幕が開く

現在を遥か超え
轟音の羽ばたきが
with my dream
地上に降り注ぐ

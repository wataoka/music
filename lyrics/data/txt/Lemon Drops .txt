Unskillful play and sugary voice
Self-confident girl's thoughtless idea
just funny
What is it? first taste
just fuzzy

My honest rule was broken right away
And you removed my fetter easily
I can fly,I can fly
and I dry
This feeling is true

I want to hear more her songs
Hello,Hello,her rock
It's homesick, and new and unique
That changed my world

The word which is probably unfounded
Though it's so,it has been attracted
I will try,I will try
And I cry
This feeling is real

I want to hear more her songs
Hello,Hello,her rock
It's homesick, and new and unique
That changed my world
Break that wall
And shake this soul
That changed my all

I want to hear more her songs
Hello,Hello,her rock
She makes me excited many times
I want to hear more her songs
Hello,Hello,her rock
It's homesick, and new and unique
That changed my world

That changed my world
That changed my all
More lemon drops!

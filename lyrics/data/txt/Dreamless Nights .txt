So many days We'd spent precious moment
We laughed and sang always in harmony
You knew you meant so much to me

Last summer's night We shared a glass of wine
We spent our time over a candle light
Lost in our dream making sweet love

Remember you said you would be
Forever by my side

Don't let me down
Don't let me down any more
Just tell me again you love me
Don't let me down
Don't let me down any more
Just tell me We'd be the same again together

So many times I had sleepless night
Wouderin' why you vanished from my sight
You knew I love you, I still do

So many times I had dreamless nights
I don't know why we couldn't see the light
You knew I meant so much to you

Remember we went through the pain
But nothing was in vain

Don't let me down
Don't let me down any more
Just tell me again you love me
Don't let me down
Don't let me down any more
Just tell me We'd be the same again together

Don't hide your pain
Someday you'll forget him
Words of comfort and grief
Blow through me and leave

Soon you'll begin
To see how we'll get through this
Our home our life built ahead
Will fall for nothing my love...

Just feel me on
Just dear be strong
Just feel me on
I left you
Let the whole world believe that's true....

I've seen so many roads
That lead to where hope surrenders
But stay as strong as the weeds
You never know dear
What life tweeds

Find your new strength
Find your only answer
When fate looses its way
We'll find each other again someday

Just feel me on
Just dear be strong
Just feel me on
I Left You let the whole world believe
I Left You and they'll never believe what's true

Just feel me on
Just dear be strong

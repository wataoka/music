the railroad clatters like a rattlebox of mine
going to the place where everyone's waiting for me
with their lovely smile
except the day with dozing off.
i always gaze out the window
try to spin my thoughts, moving like smoke, into the
crystals

clattering along the rail
staring at the curved trees and the sleeping birds on
the cables
the gossips on the NY post
people chatting on the phone
making a music tickling my ear

when the train floats into the sky
it is going across the bridge to the city
when the train floats into the sky
going across the bridge
going back to the city i live in
but i don't know whether i like or not

i'm home, i'm home
i'm thinking i'd better to stay for a couple more days
i'm home
although you're not here anymore

the railroad clatters like a rattlebox of mine
reaching at my station
where everyone's struggling with their smile

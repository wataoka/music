You'll back for more
You'll back for more

Once is all it takes when you with me
Try and there's no way out
Come along for the ride it will be
All and more you'll see

You'll be back for more 必ず
Much more than before あなたも
You'll be back for more 私に
Much more than before
Over and over again

誰もいない部屋で あなたと二人きり
キャンドルのライトが グラスのワインに
妖しく 溶けてゆく

一度 触れただけで
二度と戻れない
海のように深い
愛に落ちる…

You'll be back for more 必ず
Much more than before あなたも
You'll be back for more 私に
Much more than before
Over and over again

こんなふうになると ずっと思ってたわ
あなたもきっと そう…私と同じこと
ずっと待ったでしょう

もっと もっと強く
何度も抱いて…
運命感じるほど 熱く甘く…

You'll be back for more 必ず
Much more than before あなたも
You'll be back for more 私に
Much more than before
Over and over again

I'm the one
The one for you
Try me once and there is
Just no way out
Believe me it's true
Never no doubt
You'll be back for more

You'll be back for more 必ず
Much more than before あなたも
You'll be back for more 私に
Much more than before
Over and over again

Once is all it takes when you with me
Try and there's no way out
Come along for the ride it will be
All and more you'll see

You'll be back for more 必ず
Much more than before あなたも
You'll be back for more 私に
Much more than before
Over and over again

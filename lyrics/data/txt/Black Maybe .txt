Black maybe or maybe it's just one you say 
Black maybe or maybe this is just your color for today 
You've seen the way they've done your bow 
And the bow's still down after three hundred years 
Like maybe you better come around 
  
Black maybe or maybe you just talkin' trash 
Black maybe yeah or maybe your color I better not ask 
You've seen the way they done your bow 
And the bow's still crying for days in and days out 
Black woman you better wash your man's tears away 
  
Maybe you're red, or maybe you're green 
But your real color l've never seen 
Oh oh black maybe or maybe you're just talkin' trash 
Tell me black maybe or really would you rather for me 
not to ask 
You see the time is running out and your man's been sad 
For ages and ages and ages 
Black maybe it's time for you to wake up, come around,
come around

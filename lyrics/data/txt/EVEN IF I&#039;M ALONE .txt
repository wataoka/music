My friends have gone and traveled forâ€¦
(Oh volunteer world)
Just gentle people deep down
Doing good deeds for the others
I wonder if I do enough?
(Oh for other people)
What can I do to go on
Helping people everyday?

Just to be an attractive girl!
Oh an attractive boy!
Even alone Even alone Even alone And everyone
Will come around and say Hello to me!

I realize how small I am
I do not want to beat out special
Someone that I'm in love
Don't want to lose the dreams I have
Today I found out what it is
I must do, what a day!

Just to be an attractive girl!
Oh an attractive boy!
Even alone Even alone Even alone And everyone
Will come around and say Hello to me!

Just to be an attractive girl!
Oh an attractive boy!
Even alone Even alone Even alone And everyone
Will come around and say hello to
Come around and say hello to
Come around and say Hello to me!

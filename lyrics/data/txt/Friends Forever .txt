Just when I thought
I'd have to make it alone
You were right there by my side
Making a stand holding my hand the way you do
There to remind me about me and you
When I'm with you all my fear disappears
Like if I reached I'd touch the sky
You've got my back, pick up my slack when I can't see
But nothing picks me up like knowing we'll be

Friends forever Face whatever
Friends forever Yeah, we never can be torn apart

You and me, we are so one and the same
The way we think the way we play
Right from the start so off the charts about this thing
But we didn't know at first that we were making

Friends forever Bound together
Friends forever Yeah, will always be there

Oh yes there also can be times that get rough
And all that can be said is sorry
But we both know that that's all meaningless stuff
And we'll go on together through any nasty weather Yeah!

Friends forever Bound together
Friends forever Face whatever

Friends forever Bound together
Friends forever Face whatever

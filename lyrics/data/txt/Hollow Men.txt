a morning impurified dully, is starving
a night to be stained by the merciless dark

the orbit this planet goes into is destined
to be a distorted circle, forever

I curse today I am living on, cause it's same as yesterday
the uncertainty of tomorrow, I fear for

at the moment I realized, it all had been collapsed
I do nothing but I stand frozen there

a yoke to weigh down those who living with burdens
equally, ties everyone down to the earth

a struggle to call down a curse on his fate
like the dead mob rising to its feet on the ground

break today down I'd been living for, it'll be the same old yesterday
the uncertainty of tomorrow, got shattered

even if you look down and shut your heart to it
the fangs, starving for blood never be gone away

in this world, it's about to fall into ruin
the dead that's in vain, wriggles and crawls around everywhere

gonna keep on fighting, I don't know what it is for
having a fear, trembling and tears, I just keep myself together

break today down I'd been living for, it'll be the same old yesterday
the uncertainty of tomorrow, got shattered

even if the future hope finally gone away
I won't be a slave for the despair, never

a sweet mortal world, it's about to fall into decay
the swarm of the dead, groans and roars around anywhere

now it's the time to throw your hesitation off
still have a fear, but they're near, I just run out through this town alone

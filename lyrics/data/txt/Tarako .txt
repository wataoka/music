I stare into the mirror
Flashback on us together
Warm nights moonlight surrender
Right now it's all stormy weather

Rain's falling again
Here comes a tear
For my distant lover
Pain's calling again
She's not home when
I need to share my love

I miss the tender moments
Wish I could call and tell her
I swim in deep emotion
I'd drown without my umbrella

Rain's falling again
Here comes a tear
For my distant lover
Pain's calling again
What can I do 'cos
I just can't forget her love

I'm packing my bags tonight
Turn to the wind and
chase the sound of thunder
How can't I make it right
When she's gone from me
Oh, oh, she let go -
But I'm holding on
And I'm still looking through
The window pane

I walk into the sunlight
Another lonely morning
Daybreaks and feels the danger
Heartbreaks without any warning

Rain's falling again
Here comes a tear
For my distant lover
Pain's calling again
She's not home when
I need to share my love

I'm packing my bags tonight
Turn to the wind and
chase the sound of thunder
How can't I make it right
When she's gone from me
Oh, oh, she let go -
But I'm holding on
And now there's nothing left for me to do

Ohâ€¦Rain's falling again
Here comes a tear
For my distant lover
Pain's calling again
She's not home when
I need to share my love

Rain's falling again
Here comes a tear
Pain's calling again
What can I do

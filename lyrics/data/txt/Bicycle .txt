Don't wanna fall on my head
Don't wanna botch up my chain
The air is so thick
You know, it's edible

First time I felt out of place
Took me a while to embrace
The whole notion of balance and gravity

My chin wasn't up where was I headin'?
I'm closin' in on a fire hydrant
Disaster's waitin' ain't goin' far
I get up, I get up, don't give up
I reassemble it all

I found out
You'll do it if you wanna do it

Can't get you out of my head
Yeah, you're my ball and my chain
I bet it all with my soul and then credit it

First time I fell on my face
Tried at it day after day
I keep tryin' and tryin', ya ya ya ya ya ya

I know that it's workin'â€˜cause it makes me tired
Nothin' comes easy efforts multiply

A jolt top encourage, baby light my fire
I'll take it if you cater
Now stop, yeah, wait it's comin'

I found out
You'll do it if you wanna do it

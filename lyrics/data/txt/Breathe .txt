You put yourself in a world of the night
Dark as the vintage wine
Whispers of lies and the smells of a crime
people are hiding there knives

You better run away....

Open the window to breathe
Take an action to move on
You've gotta take yourself believe
That you still got the power to see the light
So breathe

Beautiful face that hides the pain
Cold and blue as the rain
Almost forgotten cos no one cares
What's behind your tears

You better run away...

Open the window to breathe
Take an action to move on
You've gotta take yourself believe
That you still got the power to see the light
So breathe...

I know how hard you've tried so many times
And I know it hurts so bad
But I want you to step out from where you are now
Baby trust me....

Open the window to breathe
Take an action to move on
You've gotta take yourself believe
That you still got the power to see the light
So breathe

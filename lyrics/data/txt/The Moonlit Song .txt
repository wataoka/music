Who calls me in the moonlight?
The voice that lingers in my heart
Who ever calls me on and on?
The voice that whispers so far, so close
From the outside of the sphere 

One hug or two
That's all I want
If you're gonna give it
Give it with all your might
So I'll never lose my dream again 

The tears I shed
That's all you need
Now you look around and see
Flowers are bloomin'
That's one of the miracles I've made for you 

Memories, So much pleasure and sorrow with them
Sometimes I wanna throw them away
But, Everytime reaches one voice 

Who calls me in the moonlight?
The voice that lingers in my sould
Who ever calls me on and on?
The voice I hardly can resist to hear
Tell me who I belong to 

The moon is full
How long I've been waitin' for your smile
How can I measure
The love of eternity in me 

So deep in pain
You've gone too far
Let me come closer
So I can feel where it hurts in your achin' heart
Now close your eyes 

Reach out for the wheels that carries our lives
Lay your hand on the current of time
Have we been in a dream from the start? 

Who calls me in the moonlight
The voice that lingers in my heart
Who ever calls me on and on?
The voice that I used to hear before
Who calls me in the moonlight
The voice that lingers in my heart
Who ever calls me on and on?
The voice that I used to hear before

I think of how it all was made
Each detail of this world portrayed
In bursts of color, every sight and sound
The wide blue sky and the immobile ground

It's all too great to understand
The moon, with one stroke of his hand,
Started to glow and all the stars appeared
How did it all end up here?

I am here at this crucial time
Hope I find what I come to find oooh
I'm destined to be, the way I'm meant to be
I have to find my way

This is the secret of my life
Learn to love and always seek for what is right
And learn all things change, some flowers die while others grow
Some gifts are only seen, not held
There are lots of things I still don't know

I feel your gentle smile sometimes
But know I can't go back in time
I won't fight even all these lonely tears
'Cause they allow me to be close to you

Summer turns cold, red leaves fly by
Seasons change but they don't ask why oooh
All part of this maze, long nights before the dawn
And I have your song

This is the secret of my life
Learn to love and always seek for what is right
And learn all things change, som flowers die while others grow
Some gifts are only seen, not held
Seldom understood, but felt

I know that you muse think of me
So you are never far
I can be where you are
This is the secret of my life
Learn to love and always seek for what is right
All life must change, just like water falls and turns to clouds again
Some gifts are lost and som return
There are lots of things I still must learn

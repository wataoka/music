There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go,
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies,
Love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?

I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye,
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

雨に降られて帰ろう
仕事切られたんだ今日
君はやさぐれた顔で勝手言うんだね
明日からどうしようって
ため息といら立ちで
愛も未来も ねぇ 枯らす気なの?

I know it's hard boy to accept the rules have changed
Now I'm the one who's making sure the bills are paid
Did you ever think perhaps I feel the same
No one else to blame
Your attitude's just lame

Just because you're fed up
八つ当たりは毒よ out on me
Just because you're fed up
世界はありのまま Don't you see?
Just because you're fed up
八つ当たりは酷よ out on me
Just because you're fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Don't you take it out on me
Just because

“How'd you expect things to be between us?
Feels like I've been locked up, put in handcuffs
Now I'm caught up in no mans land
Girl don't you understand

I'm trying to put things together baby
On the grind on the hustle daily
Situation is driving me crazy
This weren't the plan

Just because you're fed up
八つ当たりは毒よ out on me
Just because you're fed up
世界はありのまま Don't you see?
Just because you're fed up
八つ当たりは酷よ out on me
Just because you're fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Don't you take it out on me
Just because

Just because you're fed up
八つ当たりは毒よ out on me
Just because you're fed up
世界はありのまま Don't you see?
Just because you're fed up
八つ当たりは酷よ out on me
Just because you're fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up, fed up
Don't you take it out on me
Just because

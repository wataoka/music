In this place, I have to stay?
My memory wearing off
I lost my name

Is this dark haze that you said?
I walk like a lost child
I lost your face

If everything could be imaginary one
Can I be resigned to losing end?
Is this where I live?
Or is this where I leave?

Eternal flame
The hollow world I see, the sorrow deeply I feel
Now they're perfectly burned out
Eternal flame just back in my hands
Like a double-edged sword
I don't care
It's time I have to go that way
Cause I got ready to break my endless days

In this place, I have to dive?
There's no time for guessing at
I lost the game

Is this your craze that you drive?
I'm confusing like a child
I lost your faith

If everything could be oblivious one
Can I get freedom from losing end?
Is this where I live?
Or is this where I leave?

Eternal flame
The hollow world I see
So slowly cutting in the deepest
We're violently screaming out
Eternal flame just back in my hands
Like trouble with doubt
I don't care
It's time I have to go that way
Cause I got ready to break my endless days

Eternal flame
The hollow world I see, the sorrow deeply I feel
Now they're perfectly burned out
Eternal flame just back in my hands
Like a double-edged sword
I don't care
It's time I have to go that way
Cause I got ready to break my endless days

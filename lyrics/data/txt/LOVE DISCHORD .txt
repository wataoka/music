She was standing on the sunny hill
Breathing every single pleasant feeling
Even though the world is turning lonely eyes

She decided taking funny pills
Slowly falling into shallow sleeping
Even though the world is turning lonely eyes

So sweet
I kill you
So sweet
I kill them all
Kill them all

She was standing on the sunny hill
Breathing every single pleasant feeling
Even though the world is turning lonely eyes

Don't remember who's the funny song
Don't remember who's the funny singing
Even though the world is turning lonely eyes

So sweet
I kill you
So sweet
I kill them all
Kill them all

No one ever touched her chilly feet
No one ever touched her shallow sleep

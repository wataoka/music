I have my something place
Place is in my mind
Mind is gonna change itself
I just wanna know something true

You know love is blind?
We need that meaning's from
All I do is dance
Please tell me what is true

Let me know, Let me know, Let me know
Let's finding your own voices

Get laid, Get laid
Walk around, stand up, for yourself
Just freak out let it go
It won't be the same

I don't want to fall to pieces
I've taken my beating
And when you're feeling empty

When my time comes
When I'm done here
What am I leaving
But no one else cared

Let me know, Let me know, Let me know
Let's finding your own voices

Get laid, Get laid
Walk around, stand up, for yourself
Just freak out let it go
It won't be the same

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Walk around, stand up, for yourself
Just freak out let it go
It won't be the same

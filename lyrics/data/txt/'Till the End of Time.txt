You turned the light on
So I could see
All the love deep inside of me
You hush my sorrow, close my eyes
And I'll be yours
'Till the end of time

This kind of love
You can't deny
There's no excuse
There's no decline
When two heart as one you find,
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time

You were standing there
Without a word
And then I knew that love was real
If each tomorrow
I find you smile
Yes, I'll forrow
'Till the end of time

And I'll be yours
'Till the end of time

Until the end of time
That's how long this love is
'Till the end of time
I'll be yours

You turned the light on
So I could see
All the love deep of inside of me
You hush my sorrow, close my eyes
And I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time

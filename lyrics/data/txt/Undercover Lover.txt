All you have left's a Memory
Picture of me spying on you
Searching your heart
Right from the start
I knew that no one would love me like you do

AII you have left's a Memory
Image of you spying on me
Searching your soul
You didn't know
I never would go away

Undercover
You're my lover
They'll never separate us

Whisper your secrets they're safe with me
Kiss me but I'll never tell

（Interlude）

Undercover
You're my lover
They'll never separate us

Whisper your secrets they're safe with me
Kiss me but I'll never tell

All you have left's a Memory
Picture of me spying on you
Searching your heart
Right from the start
I knew that you were all mine.

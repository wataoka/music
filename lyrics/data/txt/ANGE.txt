Ange, Holy Ange.
On a Friday gold room, rock rings shown.
On Saturday yellow moon, rock kiss brown.
On Sunday black noon, knock his crown.
On Monday ivory roof, look peace town.
On Tuesday red cocoon, clock ticks dawn.
On Wednesday green soup, cook sleep grown.
On Thursday cloud soot, tomb beep gown.
And on the Friday white bloom, wing falling down.
Ange, Holy Ange, sleep pretty darling.

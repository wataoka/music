Is there still that pub?
That broken loudspeaker.
Spooky bad meat dish.
Smells! smells!

Beer glass with small bugs.
Bloodstained styrene foam.
The master talks very much.
Smile! smile!

I have to run away.
That fearful memory.

Is there still that pub?
Reptile of that bottling
For what was that put?
Trash! trash!

Brown soup with his hair.
I found it after I ate.
But he's well-meaning.
Trash! trash!

I have to run away.
That fearful memory.
I thought it was not real.

every morning 8:15
jumping up, out of the bed
getting back to real world
rise and shine !

but mom ?!
iguess i don't have any time to eat this up
really sorry about that...
i'm being late !

oh ! my ! gosh ! i made it !
riding same train at same door
pushing same faces inside like a canned tuna

not to waste the time
he is reading the paper
she is sending eee-mails by the phone

written,
"hi, it's me.
i'm on my way to work and how about you ?..."
not bad, but no great sensation

朝から あたしは頭痛が痛い
i don't care even if it's not GRAMMATICAL
like this awful [expletive-deleted]in' headaches
that i'm having VERY now
my life never waits, just goes on...

working in cafe
keep on serving 9 to 5
wearing white outfit that looks SO waitress

taking care of the people
thanking for tips on the table
and don't forget always SMILE

saying,
"hi. i'm meg.
may i now take your orders ?..." things like that
and have some kind of nice conversation

朝から あたしは頭痛が痛い
even though it ddoesn't sound INTELLIGENT
like this awful [expletive-deleted]in' headaches
that i'm having VERY now
my life never stops, just goes on...

それでも あたしの頭痛は痛い
even though it ddoesn't sound INTELLIGENT
like this awful [expletive-deleted]in' headaches
that i'm having VERY now
my life never stops, just goes on
my love never stops, i love you

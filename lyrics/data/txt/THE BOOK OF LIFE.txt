Long ago somewhere in the future
In a place beyond space and time
There's a book for all to see
What has been, what could be
Prophesies of the ages

Every little joy, every sorrow
Every little tear that is cried
Every word and deed
Every thought and feeling
All written there on the pages

Some embrace only shadow
Some embrace the light
But the lives that we lead
Are the stories we leave
There in the Book of life

Now this place is only a memory
Haunting as a dream from afar
And our hearts have lost the key
We don't know how to read
Signs that are there to guide us

Maybe we don't know all the answers
Maybe we can't change who we are
All we have is love
We can give our children
Love that will follow behind us

Some embrace only shadow
Some embrace the light
But the lives that we lead
Are the stories we leave
There in the Book of Life

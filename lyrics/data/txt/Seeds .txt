(she's) living by the sea
and she finds a floating seed

she dreams to sprout the seed
waters it day after day
and day after day

it's harder than you know
waiting for to come

sometime you say you say
it's just little seeds in the sand
but someday you'll see you'll see
a flower you've never seen

years and years had passed
one day there was a flower bud

when she finally sees a flower bloom
it was after many long years
many long years

it's harder than you know
waiting for to come

sometime you say you say
it's just little seeds in the sand
but someday you'll see you'll see
a flower you've never seen before

years.. and years..
and day atter day..

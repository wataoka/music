Tonight the love that took a long time to realize, but now I know
Every time we'd meet we would always finish with an argument
Our love, it was without shape, I didn't wanna think it was true
It made me feel so scared but now I have you

There's a kind of night, it's a alright,
even angels go to sleep
Together in your arms, feels so calm,
the time has come and you can stay here
Now it is so much better than before
-we have found a deeper kind of love

You are sleepy now, you're tired,
but you still find that you want to talk some more
Time for sleep, please go,
baby don't you worry, we'll feel the same tomorrow
It was only for a short time the two of us were trying to find
Someone else to love but now I know

There's a kind of night, it's a alright, even angels go to sleep
Lying next to me, I see your face, with you, now and forever more
We know that's how it was meant to be,
growing old together naturally

We should talk of our lives ahead,
take the time to plant flowers to grow in the fields as we go
In happy times and in sad times, no matter what,
we'll share them all, we'll be fine cause we're not alone

There's a kind of night, it's a alright, even angels go to sleep
Times is moving on, but still the memories fill me with a glow
It is so much better than before we have found a deeper kind of love

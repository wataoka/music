重ねた手の平が wish 君の鼓動 overlap
じっと無口なまま stay 僕は耐えきれず
Please say yes, yes, yes, what can I do?

期待しちゃダメなのに よけい痛いのに
夢みたいな something 起きやしないのに
Please say yes, yes, yes, what can I do?

Image it !
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Where am I going? 未来を wake it up

笑っていてくれよ Whether you tell me"NO NO NO"
今日の天気みたいに Don't be sorry, baby
I say yes, yes, yes, while crying"yes"

Image it !
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
いつも looking for 明日を make it up

Please say yes, yes, yes, what can I do?

Image it !
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Where am I going? 未来を wake it up

Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
Keep your hands with mine. Beautiful day
魅かれた方が恋の loser
さめざめ泣く準備は OK
すがるように伝えてみるさ

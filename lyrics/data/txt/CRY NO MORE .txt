Cry no more
I'm your eyes when sight has gone
Make a wish upon that star
I will be there for you

Cry no more
Spread your wings and fly so far
'cross the seas to distant shores
Always be there for you

When I close my eyes
I see the darkness
fade into a memory

Seen the light
shining so bright
The dawning of a better day

Everything that you believe
will give you all the strength that you need
to carry on

Cry no more
When your friends have all gone home
There's no need to be alone
I will be there for you

Look up to the skies you'll realize
I live for all eternity

Take a look within your heart
A love for all the world to see

Everything that you believe
will give you all the strength that you need
to carry on

You know that
walking down the road of life there will always be pain
And the weight is so strong
that you can't go on

But you can turn it around just reach for me yeah
You know that I will always be there
My love will set you free

When I close my eyes
I see the darkness
fade into a memory

Seen the light
shining so bright
The dawning of a better day

Everything that you believe
will give you all the strength that you need
to carry on

Cry no more
I'm your eyes when sight has gone
Make a wish upon that star
I will be there for you

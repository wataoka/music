I still remember those nights
When I go to bed
My grandma used to put on this beautiful song
Although at the time I didn't know it was country
This song called "Tennessee Waltz"
Really touched my heart

After I lost my grandma,
I came to Nashville
To look for the things she left me
I met its beautiful music and happy people
And a part of me I didn't even know

Being in Nashville
I realized it doesn't matter what other people think
What matters is who I wanna be
Sometimes I need to leave behind
Family and friends to do what I wanna do
But above all, I need to stay true to myself always

Afraid of hurting somebody else and me
Trying to be the perfect girl
Because I believed we could be happier this way
But deep in my heart
I was hoping for someone
To reach out for me and ease my pain

I can't suddenly change everything
I'm still afraid to be naked
But wanna be true to myself, wanna stay natural
Sweet Nashville has taught me the voice of my heart
This true heart that I found will sing eternally

Being in Nashville
I realized it doesn't matter what other people think
What matters is who I wanna be
Sometimes I need to leave behind
Family and friends to do what I wanna do
But above all, I need to stay true to myself always

Above all, I need to stay true to myself always

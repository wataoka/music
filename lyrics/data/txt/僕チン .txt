I was pretty ridiculed cuz my thoughts won't come out
They must've hate me
Never lets me pass the border line

If I only could get away with all these messy doughtiness
Then I'll be so free to come out of this ……….

Yo,
Hi ladies and gentlemen I'd like to introduce myself
I wished my name was "dick"so that everyone in the world know that
I have a dick and you don't have one
And I'm the best and you're the others

Well shut the fuck up, my name isn't so
You can calm down and relax have a nice sleep and so on
And go on and show off like your sister did Ho-Ho I can't explain it
To you but one thing tu-lu

あのね 俺ね 本音 言うね たまに死にたいと思っているねん
だけど日本で年間に三万人も自殺者がいて
俺もその中の一人に普通になるのはカッコ悪いからね
「とりあえず」生きている僕 「とりあえず」死んでいく君
それはね 君がね 意味がねぇ 生き方しているからだけれどね

Woo―― intimacy  may I be eternally
It's hard to say   that I'm living in peace
But I'll just have to say   thank you mom

Like I said its unstoppable tell me it's so unforgettable
I might not be incredible but my mind must be perpetual

All these Mets are made with miracle  that is why it's so cynical
But my words are arithmetical so will you please call me criminal

Don't you think that it's so stupid thinking about after dying?
Did you know that you haven't even really lived your life yet?

童貞卒業平均年齢 十六歳の世の中ですね
ジーパンにシャツ 入れているヤツが馬鹿にされる世の中は まずいからね
そんなのも 変えてみよう どうなのよ??

Well, I don't care whether who you are
All I care is what you do

Like I said its unstoppable tell me it's so unforgettable
I might not be incredible but my mind must be perpetual

All these Mets are made with miracle  that is why it's so cynical
But my words are arithmetical so will you please call me criminal

Don't you think that it's so stupid thinking about after dying?
Did you know that you haven't even really lived your life yet?

Sometimes I hate this world meantime I love this world
Joking and choking but no one's shoking me

Martin Luther King, I wish you were alive
And ask all my question and blow up my head off
Will you please

Woo―― intimacy  may I be eternally
It's hard to say   that I'm living in peace
But I'll just have to say   thank you mom

Like I said its unstoppable tell me it's so unforgettable
I might not be incredible but my mind must be perpetual

All these Mets are made with miracle  that is why it's so cynical
But my words are arithmetical so will you please call me criminal

Don't you think that it's so stupid thinking about after dying?
Did you know that you haven't even really lived your life yet?

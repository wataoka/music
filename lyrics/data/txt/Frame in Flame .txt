cloud cover over the fiction frame
この心と対話繰り返す
waht do you think?

光のimagination line
遮断してみても無力なこの夜

理想の先紙一重
the good and bad

翼を広げて見渡すのさ
"sorry, what's your name again...?"
消えてく flame of freedom
as far as I can go 抱き締めて

cloud cover over the fiction truth
鏡の前蜃気楼のサイン揺れてる

reasons try to rule everything
意味が無くても彷徨う距離感へ

犠牲になる心の声
black or white

翼を広げて見渡すのさ
"so... what's your name again...?"
消えてくflame of freedom
as far as we can go
why don't you come with me in the frame?

cloud cover over the fiction live
how do you feel? and imagination ignite
the good and bad,
enfolding darkness of night

翼を広げて見渡すのさ
"sorry, what's your name again...?"
消えてく flame of freedom
as far as we can go
why don't you come with me in the frame?

as far as I can go 抱き締めて

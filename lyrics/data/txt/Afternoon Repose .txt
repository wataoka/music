Silent afternoon
Curtains swept up by a gentle breeze
Floating memories
In hours like these of the days that we share

Like an ending summer eclipse
Sweet sun pours in from the window
And this shadowed room turns into gold
Outshinning sorrow

In this peace of mind, no apprehensions
I've found my own - a bright reflection
Something calm and strong, I can't explain it
and it's embracing me

I'll wake up to the morning sun here comes another day

and somehow know everything will be OK.

Wind chime, lullabies
Calling me into my garden
Where we kissed the seeds to grow and to bloom
tenderly in the spring

Daydreams arise in sunshine's glory
Midday repose, a simple story
Something calm and strong, I can't explain it
and it's embracing me

Past the yearning, I learned to temper my sorrow
Memories of you, I'll take to tomorrow
Coz I am glad I awoke to this calmness
You lead me to

In this peace of mind, no apprehensions
I've found my own - a bright reflection
Something calm and strong, I can't explain it
and it's embracing me
I'll wake up to the morning sun here comes another day

and reminisce Love's afternoon repose

Cheering you when you are hanging on
Till the dream has come true you and me
Don't give up honey! Make a promise me
Be with you I will always stand for you

Yesterday gave it to me
A picture from your phone
Made a funny face purposely
Never change like the old days

If we can be devoted for one thing in our life
Will be good enough for a wonderful life
Chasing a dream with eyes on

Do we know where is the start from
How far do we have to go for?
We can't get this answer forever never

Destiny! That you decided yourself
Just the way you are with honestly
It doesn't matter honey! How far we're apart
Think of you all day all night

Cheering you when you are hanging on
Till the dream has come true you and me
Don't give up honey! Make a promise me
Be with you I will always stand for you

If we can be devoted for one thing in our life
Will be good enough for a wonderful life
Chasing a dream with eyes on

Do we know where is the start from
How far do we have to go for?
We can't get this answer forever never

Destiny! That you decided yourself
Just the way you are with honestly
It doesn't matter honey! How far we're apart
Think of you all day all night

Cheering you when you are hanging on
Till the dream has come true you and me
Don't give up honey! Make a promise me
Be with you I will always stand for you

Be with you I will always stand for you

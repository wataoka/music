Shining all the time to me.
Smiling you back say Hi to you.
And walking on the street with holding hands.

大事なものはそんなにない。
手ぶらの心でなにつかもう?
素直になれた日曜の午後。
あなたが特別と気付く。

Don't forget a sign of love. (now you kiss me)
Don't forget give me a big big hug and smile.

Going out to watch the movie.
Having ice cream with extra whipped cream.
And driving to the beach to play with our Donna.

Shining all the time to me.
Smiling you back say Hi to you.
And walking on the street with holding hands.

雲の上はいつだって晴れ。
近すぎて見えない幸せ。
目線を変えれば見えてくる。
出会いあふれてるこの街。

Just remember I'm with you. (Show me your love)
Just remember always we are together.

Going out to watch the movie.
Having ice cream with extra whipped cream.
And driving to the beach to play with our Donna.

Shining all the time to me.
Smiling you back say Hi to you.
And walking on the street with holding hands.

(Shine) Shining all the time
(Smiling) Smiling you back
(Walking) Walking on the street with holding hands.

Shining all the time to me.
Smiling you back say Hi to you.
And walking on the street with holding hands.
Shining all the time to me.
Smiling you back say Hi to you.
And walking on the street with holding hands.

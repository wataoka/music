Don't you see me?
Don't you see me?
Hey I'm standing here again sing again see you again

Don't you hear me?
Don't you hear me?
Hey I'm standing here again sing again see you again

If you are fed up with the parroted silly days
Let's hang out and kick em out right away
We just need to mash and dive

Don't you tell me?
Don't you tell me?
Why don't you sing our song again till you are up again?

Don't worry
Don't worry
Why don't you sing our song again till you are up again?

When you feel so down and don't know where to be
Let's hang out and catch our dreams right away
We just need to mash and dive

If you need your friend, I'll be here
Don't ever turn away
Change will come and change is here
I assure you that are true
Awful days I'll soon go by
Take it easy for a white
Time will tell then time will ease
So let's mash and dive
Until we find the truth

So let's mash and dive

生きてるって事、何気ない事にだって最高に思える瞬間がある
嫌な事だってあるし悩む事もある そんな全てが最高なんだ
大切な家族、大切な友達に支えられて生きてる自分がいるし、
いろんな人との出会いも最高なんだよ
この場所からは空が見える この場所からは山が見える
そしてこの場所からは笑っている自分の姿が見えるんだ

繊細でアバウトな feeling
揺れる afternoon
螺旋状に描いて tracing
Let it turn around
夢で wait and see

性愛は necessary evil
鼓動の frequency
抑制と愛と involution
Let it go around
愛は hide-and-seek

All I want is something good
Wanna feel so good
I know you can make me feel

Almost heaven
肌色の rhythm
君となら feel alright
Almost heaven
This is what I wanted
But, I want some more

躊躇いと出会いの illusion
衝動の latency
曖昧で不確かな reason
Let it be around
胸の this and that

All I want is something good
Wanna feel so good
I know you can make me feel

Almost heaven
七色の prism
君となら feel alright
Almost heaven
This is what I wanted
But, I want some more

撮影は一時の vision
答えは vacancy
Love is here and there

All I want is something good
Wanna feel so good
Maybe love can do
Can you feel it too?
All I want is something good
Wanna feel so good
Only you can make me feel

Almost heaven
肌色の rhythm
君となら feel alright
Almost heaven
This is what I wanted
夢で feel it

Almost heaven
七色の prism
そう 君と feel alright
Almost heaven
Now I've got what I wanted
But, I want some more
Oh, I want some more

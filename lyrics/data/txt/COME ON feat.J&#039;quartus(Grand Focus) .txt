They say it's not as complex as you think
Hun?... I know, I know.... and on and on and so,
Why not Put your TROUSERS on?

Hoody Juve 俺ちっとも改心しちゃいねぇさ
Freak it, Dig it And I'm gon' get it
大袈裟な旅にBeat it ほら 決めてかかるような気分じゃねぇ 好きに
Lifeそこに無かったら また歩いて見つけりゃいい
日々粋に Sunbeam Dream
時に Men, I know you lie Silly I don't care 'bout it
Reebok classics FRED PERRY
想い馳せてKick it 西に で Atlantic Mind WA
おまえとなら夢で 素敵な気分さ Can feel it
ZAHHHN ZAZA ZA mn ZAHHHHN tell me
ヒデェぜ 急に Damn it
But 慣れっこさ 事態 Easy Spin it
仕舞っとけよ Flick Knife in your pocket

What?! Head, PINS uh-uh
uh-uh
Hat, Shirts, Pants, n' Socks, Boots.... Shoes
Words evaporate J, sing it wit me c'mon

YEA JUST STEP INTO THE BRAND NEW WORLD
SO COME ON COME ON COME ON
YEA WON'T YOU COME ALONG
YEA IT GOES AROUND AND 'ROUND IN CIRCLES
COME ON COME ON COME ON
YEA WON'T YOU COME ALONG

巡る巡る景色 意味など
問いも説きもせずに
Just feel all of the flow
気付いたら walkin' on my way
not on purpose baby
たまに空見上げるように
Such a simple life, yea It's just like that
No one knows what future is like
but I think 確かに繋がってる今と未来
見る事のできない past and future
共にこの時間から生まれ記憶と想像の狭間で

Walkin' again
uh-hun, whatever
Yes sure If you say so,...
Take three ha-ha I've got a taste for it too

YEA JUST STEP INTO THE BRAND NEW WORLD
SO COME ON COME ON COME ON
YEA WON'T YOU COME ALONG
YEA IT GOES AROUND AND 'ROUND IN CIRCLES
COME ON COME ON COME ON
YEA WON'T YOU COME ALONG

Let the truth be known
JUST BECAUSE, THERE IS NO REASON
THIS IS WHAT I WAS GIVEN
I wouldn't know about that anyway
Because we've got it all you know?!
JUST BECAUSE, LET ANYTHING BE A REASON
THAT IS HOW I AM LIVIN'
I get along just singin' my story yea so,
Now Followin' the good steps
And....

RAINBOW シケってる微笑さへ当然のLoop ん中で気ままに
ダチでいりゃあそれで
大勢でいつもつるんでんの好きじゃねぇ
どーれ今日の風 ほら 誇らし気さ 強くBlowin' なびかせてる木々
超ハッとするような想いがマジだったら そん時こそ 共に行こう

YEA JUST STEP INTO THE BRAND NEW WORLD
SO COME ON COME ON COME ON
YEA WON'T YOU COME ALONG
YEA IT GOES AROUND AND 'ROUND IN CIRCLES
COME ON COME ON COME ON
YEA WON'T YOU COME ALONG

But takin' a look around We've got nothin' on
This feelin's fair yea.... and so wonderful
Still speakin' it rough and livin' tough in the whole scene you know?!
I Ain't Thinkin' Nothin' Bout It

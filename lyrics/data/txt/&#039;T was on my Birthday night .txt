Long ago
Mama said to me
on my Birthday night
"Make a wish Koko,make a wish
and blow out candles,
your wish will come true"
Long Long time ago
Mama told me a lie

Long ago
You sang to me
on my Birthday night
"Never cry Cocko, never cry
Smile all the time…
I'll be waiting for you"
Long Long time ago
You told me a lie

I said"I love your way"
You said you loved me too
I said "I'd stand by you"
You said you never leave me alone
I told you a lie
Now I light the candles
and close my eyes again
That's all I can do baby
no-one to blame now
You know you can't hear me

Long Long time ago
Mama told me a lie
"Make a wish Koko,make a wish…"

you dont wanna take me on
eat my dust there on the highway
when enoughs enough
hit the road or do it my way

you dont wanna run with me
take you places god's forsaken
make your mind up fast
now a demon here's awaken

take a breath cross the line motherfucker
eat your heart out tail lights fade away
met your match watch me burn every sucker who follows me

skyline screaming alive im living for real now (central city dreaming dreaming)
my pulse starts speeding its now i come to life (destination getting nearer)
fear no feeling alone im racing for no one (gotta face the final feeling)
ive turned my back and its now i come to life (last exit cant slow down)
cant slow down
you dont wanna mess with me
that old junk wont get you nowhere
road will spill your guts
eat you up without a prayer

you dont wanna look for me
im the face god has forsaken
dead behind the mask
asphalt cries for all ive taken

take a breath cross the line motherfucker
eat your heart out tail lights fade away
met your match watch me burn every sucker who follows me
skyline screaming alive im living for real now (central city dreaming dreaming)
my pulse starts speeding its now i come to life (destination getting nearer)
fear no feeling alone im racing for no one (gotta face the final feeling)
ive turned my back and its now i come to life (last exit cant slow down)

cant slow down

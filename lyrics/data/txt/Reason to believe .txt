What is this feeling?
Every time I close my eyes
Calling me

The very soul of me
何をしても残るlonely

But baby every time I try to say
the words that will change everything
本当のこと言わせて
You got to know what I'm feeling

Moving on You know I love you baby
Moving on Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Moving on 誰も責めないで
ふたりはこれから
Moving on I need to find a reason
Moving on I need to keep believing
Moving on 教えてほしい
傷は癒えるのか

Moving on
Turn around
Must be strong
Calling out

Gotta keep moveing
別の場所でも
You and me

So this is how it goes
広がる世界
gotta follow

I got so must to give
Think positive
A chance a new identity
昨日の自分乗り越え
見せてやるよ a new start

Turn around Only my will can save me
Turn around Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Turn around 今それぞれに
明日(あす)の世界へGo!
Turn around I need to find a reason
Turn around I need to keep believing
Turn around 教えてほしい
傷は癒えるのか

Moving on
Turn around
Must be strong
Calling out

Moving on Only my will can save me
Moving on Sometimes I think I'm crazy
Moving on 今それぞれに
明日(あす)の世界へGo!
Moving on I need to find a reason
Moving on I need to keep believing
Moving on 教えてほしい
傷は癒えるだろう?

Moving on
Turn around
Must be strong
Calling out

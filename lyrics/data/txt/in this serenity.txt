shimmering so bright
guiding light divine
flow along the sea
of fading stardust

reminisce the touch
of all the hands used to clutch
we'll be long
lost in the past
left to emancipate

we play among the clouds
in the pitch blackness night
our voices ascend to the stars
there's a will to overcome
though we stumble and frown

in this serenity
eternity

we ask the starry sky
the reason to keep our cruise
why we suffer and
struggle till end
though the darkness may prevail
alighted heart shall avail

in this serenity
eternally

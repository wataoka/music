I just quietly closed my eyes and hear a sight
the thing reminds me is only few things
your empty fandation is still rolled on the floor
there is no space to stand on

I have always been unkind to you
I don't know how many times I've made you cry

Don't you go away stay in by my side
I swear I will never let you go
Don't say good bye give me one more chance
Truely my words accept my words I would be honest

Do you remember when we first went to the bar?
that night I felt something inside
Because I'm so weak I couldn't say words to you
but you're not same as anybody else

I have never been a man for you
I don't know how many times you made me shine

Don't you go away stay in by my side
I swear I will never let you go
Don't say good bye give me one more chance
Truely my words accept my words I would be honest

Don't you go away stay in by my side
I swear I will never let you go
Don't say good bye give me one more chance
Truely my words accept my words I would be honest

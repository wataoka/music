A girl came running over to me
put the stones that she found, in my hand
when I woke up
the clock showed me
that I was left behind
with a sip of coffee

she said, this looks like jewel
then I wondered, where did my heart color go
the stone spoke in the white sheer light
it shed tears, dropped on the palette

still and stuck unfocused
launched on, hunt for 君の幻影は
まだ進めなくて couldn't take another step forward
I know, I was pathetic

if this breeze is Lord's blessing
how would I reflect
did I have a dazzling smile
when I was a child
now I am seeing too many things

she said, this looks like jewel
then I wondered, where did my heart color go
the stone spoke in the white sheer light
it shed tears, dropped on the palette

still and stuck unfocused
launched on, hunt for 君の幻影は
まだ進めなくて couldn't take another step forward
you know, I was made of plastic

jewel,
傷つく事で磨かれて
jewel all different just like us
so bright in one's heart
the stone on the sidewalk
will flourish its shine

just want you to know
I had seen upon
in spite that I hurt you, my jewel

now I am focused
launched on, hunt for 僕の声が
もう届かなくて couldn't take another step forward
you know, I was made of plastic
I know, I was pathetic

When I wish upon the moon 
Deepest dreams... 
A spark of Love 
Leaps in the Sky 
Take me into your world 

When I wish upon the moon 
Deeams come true 
I bless the day 
You found me 
I'll always stay with you 
A secret of the moon 
Let me be the sun that lights up your way 
I live for you 
I'll live for you

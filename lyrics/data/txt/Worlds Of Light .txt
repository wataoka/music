I have wondered for years
how the world's going to be.
Will love conquer fear?
Is this just a dream?

I have heard many tales
of the worlds far beyond.
Our ship soon will sail,
won't you come along.

Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, we'll find
Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, it's time
Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, yours and mine
Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, let's try

We can travel awhile,
we can see everything
I will tell you in time
of all that it means.

We can soar like the birds
we can talk to the streams
we can laugh when it rains
because we are free

I have shed many tears
wanting love to return
The harbor is clear
Full speed astern

Now our journey begins
through the worlds we have known
If it ever ends
maybe we'll be home.

Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, we'll find
Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, it's time
Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, yours and mine
Worlds of light
Worlds of light
Worlds of light, let's try

I can cry when I'm sad
I can weep for my joy
When you're down look ahead
don't you ever get mad

If you find on the way
you are lonely for home
Look around you will see
you are never alone.

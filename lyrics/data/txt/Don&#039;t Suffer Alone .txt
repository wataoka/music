Cannot walk no more
Left alone in the middle of (the) desert
We're dying from thirst
Lost our track
We blame and yell at each other

Sun falls down
We take each others' hand and stand
Feel the bond
We set off to our goals reunited
Having our heart as“one”

We will be there to save you when you're about to fall down
That's what friends (are) for
Call us in need
Do not feel lonely
We are always tied where ever
Don't suffer alone

There were times when we fought each other, cussed at each other
But yet, none of us left anyone
We kept hanging out

Brotherhood
Dear all our beloved ones
Precious ones
This song goes for you guys
Listen

We will be there to save you when you're about to fall down
That's what friends (are) for
Call us in need
Do not feel lonely
We're always tied where ever

The earth is way too big for us
Cannot bear it all alone
Life would have been boring without all of you
“Trust”can not be described by words
It's the heart inside us that can tell

As we get older
We will all break apart
Can not help it
But we're tied in our heart
Distant but Close...

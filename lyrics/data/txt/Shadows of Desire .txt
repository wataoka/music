Playing for devil's desire
I graze the full moon
Pull you into the night, I found a blue light flame

Lips touch and heat is arising,
Can't stop I'm takin' over you,
Falling into the dark, I found a blue love flame

Like flash of lightening caught in the reticence of night
I've trapped you with seduction babe no way to escape it
(Delicious Red lush the thrill of stroke)
(Secrets of Deep mellisonant Shadows)

Grooving in regular motion
Whispers of drawing tides
Looming harrowed scar
I saw the blue light fade

Smiling the little joker
I pary the muddy hall
You cling with red-stained hands
I saw the blue love fade

Like flash of lightening caught in the reticence of night
I've trapped you with seduction babe no way to escape it
(Break the spell let the Scar deface)
(Secrets of Deep mellisonant Shadows)
(Delicious Red lush the thrill of stroke)

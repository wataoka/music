Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
Motivate your anger to make them realize
Climbing the mountain.Never coming down?
Break in to the contents.Never falling down

My knee is still shaking like Iwas twelve
Sneaking out the class room by the back door
A man railed at me twice but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting for people like me

Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself in the end.

You say"dreams are dreams.
I ain't gonna play the fool anymore.
You say"cause I still got my soul."

Take your time baby your blood needs to slow down.
"Breach your soul.""Reach yourself before you gloom."
Reflection of fear makes shadows of nothing.

You still are blind if you see thewinding road.
Coz there is always a straight way to the point you see

Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself in the end.

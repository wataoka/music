I've been waiting for a miracle
Little ignoring all the signs
Thinking love would heal the wounds of love
But Instead it made me blind
It's so hard to see what's right and wrong
When your walking on the line

I know it feels like it's too late
We're getting no where at this rate

I've been looking at the road I'm on
And I'm tryin'to make some sense
I have always played by my own rules
But never at my own expense

You'd think by now I'd have the knack
Still two steps up and three steps back

If I couldn't love you with my heart
Cause I couldn't find the time
If I could not love you in this life
Then I will use these words
To make you understand
With everything I am

I thought love would heal these wounds
But instead it made me blind
Its so hard to know what's right and wrong
When your walking on the line

You'd think by now I'd have the knack
Still two steps up and three steps back

※If I couldn't love you with my heart
　If I couldn't find the time
　If I could not love you in this life
　Then I will use these words
　To make you understand
　With everything I am

※Repeat

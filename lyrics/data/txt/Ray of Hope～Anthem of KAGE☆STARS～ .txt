We're walking down this road in the dark
It's hard for us to find a ray of hope

Can we find the light?
Can we still believe from now on?

But when I take the time to go within
I hear a voice inside with all the strength

The path ahead is rough
But we shall overcome
It's up to us!!

We'll shout out Come on rock your soul
Don't you wait no more
The sun will always rise when we all believe
Let us walk the walk
Together we will go

Sing the words Come on rock your soul
Keep our spirits strong
The sun will always shine when we all believe
Let us feel the bond
Together we will go

Hey come on!!

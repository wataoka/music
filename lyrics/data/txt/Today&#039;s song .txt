I was on a bus far away
Surely the wind was blown' in
Blew by snatched my words away
And carried them slowly to you

The full cloud floats and stops
He knows about white tomorrow
The sun's too
She knows about red tomorrow

Reflect today as if on a flame
Recall the past days
Quiet blue love and today's song

The lustrous rainbow floats and stops
It awaits the colorful tomorrow
Creation gently floats and stops
It awaits the far distant today

Today
It shows today as if on fire
Pouring rain as if going over

Reflect today as if on a flame
Recall the past days
Make it rain as if blowing over

Left behind, I left behind
The sky gracefully reflects the city
Reflects the town

The lustrous rainbow floats and stops
It awaits the colorful tomorrow

Today
It shows today as if on fire
Pouring rain as if going over

Reflect today as if on a flame
Recall the past days
Make it rain as if blowing over
Ah, I left behind
The red love and today's song
Ah, I left behind
The blue love and today's song

Tell me, what ya doing here?
But you don't seem to care
This ain't your property, get the fuck outta here!

You're rewriting the rule
Don't treat us like a fool
Can't stand to see you drool
Door's that way
Get out and stay outside
Get lost never come back

Go back where you belong
You've stayed here way too long
Get out of here, outta my fuckin' yard!

Stop bragging like a bitch
You're a mite and makes me itch
If you're not paying the rent, get the fuck outta here

Let me tell you once again
Can't stand how you complain
If you don't like it here, just pack it up and leave!

Go back where you belong
You've stayed here way too long
Can't you tell right from wrong?
Shut up, don't bug me all night long
Get outta my face!

CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY
Lie after lie Doesn't make it true

CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY
My Goddamn neighbor
I'm losing my patience

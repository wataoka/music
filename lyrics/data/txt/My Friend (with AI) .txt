Can't believe, how much time has gone on by
Feels like yesterday keeps wandering back into my mind
Not a day goes by when I don't think about the days
Memories of our lives, it can't be erased

Seasons change, but let's keep walking hand in hand
To the dreams we have and all the hopes towards tomorrow and forever

Because of u I still can say that
I'm living life still standing strong
Even if by chance time passes by
and our paths don't cross again it's OK
I'll be there shud u need me there and
I'll be there to catch u when we meet again,
we can smile again, my friend

Reminiscing bout the days of yesterday
In a picture I keep thinking back to what I used to say
Distance may grow but still I'll keep u in my heart
In your eyes I keep seeing life and u must go your way

So this I'll say, u keep doing what u got to do
To the dreams you have and all the hopes towards tomorrow and forever

Because of u I still can say that
I'm living life still standing strong
Even if by chance time passes by
and our paths don't cross again it's OK
I'll be there shud u need me there and
I'll be there to catch u when we meet again,
we can smile again, my friend

No need for promises we can just say goodbye
Cuz I know I'll be seeing u again,
And I know we'll keep being each others friend
Don't worry my friend u can do it my friend
Raise your hands up in the air, reach out and fly... fly...

Because of u I still can say that
I'm living life still standing strong
Even if by chance time passes by
and our paths don't cross again it's OK
I'll be there shud u need me there and
I'll be there to catch u when we meet again,
we can smile again, my friend

Because of u I still can say that
I'm living life still standing strong

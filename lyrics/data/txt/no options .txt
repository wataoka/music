Be a memory
The world in grey
I mean nothing to you
I know it's not alright

I don't know no matter how I got this way
I had no options left

Even though you dream on
You'd not watch a dream on
It's not so in vain wherever you're gonna go
Save me, save me from myself

Be a memory
The world in shade
I mean nothing to you
You know it's not alright

I don't know no matter where you take that way
You had no options left

No one live in dark night
I won't keep it inside
It's not so in vain wherever you're gonna go
Save me, save me, save me,
you save me, save me from myself

Be a memory
The world in rain
I mean nothing to you

Even though you dream on
You'd not watch a dream on
It's not so in vain wherever you're gonna go
Save me, save me from myself
you save me, save me

No one live in dark night
I won't keep it inside
It's not so in vain wherever you're gonna go
Save me, save me, save me,
you save me, save me from myself

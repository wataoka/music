I cannot sleep tonight, because I'm looking forward to coming tomorrow.
The god, please cause the miracle again tomorrow. And,I came to like summer day.

雨の日は lonely blue 楽しみは It was always so. Lonely scenery
I do not think there is worry. ―but!
突然のTelephone callあり得ないMiracle that exceeds expectation
It is a moment when my fate changed. It is a moment when my fate changed. 
そんなrainy day

キミの温もりをForever feel itジュリエット約束の木の下で
そして今ここに誓えるよThe secret words I drew in the sky.
I say a wish to a shooting star.

Uh very sweet, lovely day very sweetそれはある夏の激しいスコール
Uh very sweet, rainy day very happy雨宿りの場所、アカシアの木

I cannot sleep tonight, because I'm looking forward to coming tomorrow.
The god, please cause the miracle again tomorrow. And,I came to like summer day.


朝一のHigh school girl軽快なbicycle technique is cool highest.
I do not think there is worry. ―but!
ライバルのSlipstreamギリギリのviolent game started. Do not shut eyes.
I want to be with the loved friends. I want to be with the loved friends.
そんなBeautiful day

キミを見つめてたBecause I love itジュリエットそして恋に落ちた
星が輝いたあの夜にThe secret words I drew in the sky.
I say a wish to a shooting star.

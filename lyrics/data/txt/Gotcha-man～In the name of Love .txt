"Gotcha-man!!"

Ain't no reason why...
What you're gonna do, my mate?
You're the ones, flying high!
And you've got the feel

Pak-tune la-ka-tune di-ki-di-da～n
Just do it! Dig it out!! Ah～n?
You're the heroes. Salvatores!!
Though, never ever determined
"Gotcha-man!!"

In the name of LOVE, they work hard
here and there,nights and days
As if they were the servants to the people
who live peacefully, gently and unconsciously
Yes! They are the ultimate weapons
to save the world
Piece of shits turn into the unbeatable network
What the hell are you?
"Gotcha-man!!"

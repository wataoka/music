YOU BITE A STRAWBERRY
AND THROW A CAKE TO MY FACE
BIRDS DRESSED IN BLACK
DYING DOGS DYING DOGS ON PARADE

YOU BITE A SAUSAGE
AND THROW A PAN PAN PANCAKE
WHITEWASHED WALL
CLAWFOOT TUB CLAWFOOT TUB IN GARAGE

STOP SHOWING DISGUSTING INSANITY
MY SPIRIT IS DEFILED IN SEEMING SEEMING SALVATION
KEEP STARING DESPARATE REALITY
MY WORLD IS SAVED BY SILLY SILLY SOLUTION
ARE YOU PLAYING THE GAME?

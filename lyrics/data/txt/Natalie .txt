She came to L.A. to be a star
It's been her dream of a lifetime
The fancy people on Rodeo Drive
She finally got to be one of them

She used to live in a small town in Georgia
And hardly writes to the folks back home now
Can't even find the time to get lonely
'Cause she's too busy doing T.V. shows

Natalie, are you really happy
With all your money and fame that you've made?
Natalie, you'd better come back home
Before it's too late for me to love you again

They say she's got a good-lookin' man beside her
Just to spend a night or two
Someday she wants to be a wife of an actor
Who can afford to live in Malibu

Natalie, are you really happy
With all your money and fame that you've made?
Natalie, you'd better come back home
Before it's too late for me to love you again

She doesn't smile anymore
She doesn't dream anymore
She doesn't even sing the song that she loved
She's getting beautiful, but
She's getting so unkind
She's never like the girl whom once I knew

Natalie, are you really happy
With all your money and fame that you've made?
Natalie, you'd better come back home
Before it's too late for me to love you again

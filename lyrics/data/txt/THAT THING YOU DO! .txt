Youâ€¦ doing that thing you do
Breaking my heart into a million pieces
Like you always do And you, don't mean to be cruel
You never even knew the heart ache
I've been going through 

Well I try and I try to forget you girl
But it's just so hard to do
Everytime you do that thing you do
I know all the games you play 
And I'm gonna find a way to let you know that
You'll be mine someday

Cause we, could be happy can't you see
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me

I try and I try to forget you girl
But it's just so hard to do
Everytime you do that thing you do
I don't ask a lot girl
But I know one thing's for sure
It's your love
I haven't got girl
And I just can't take it anymore

Cause we, could be happy can't you see
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me

Cause it hurts me so just to see you go
Around with someone new
And if I know you,you're doing that thing
And every day, just doing that thing
And I can't take you doing that thing you do!

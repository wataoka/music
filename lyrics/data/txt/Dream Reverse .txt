See you in a cloud
Watching from the haze
Hiding in the woods
Been like this for days

In this other world
That am living in
I'm a melody
And you're a violin

When I'm about to fall
You would intervene
Like you're the leadiing star
On the silver screen

And then

We would watch the universe
'til I wake up and the dream reverse us

I don't care that you never knew me
I love you
and I'm never mad that you never see me
I find you
Every time you pass me I envy
The big blue
That we solemnly traverse
When we sleep and let the dream immerse us now

We are all alone
We are pioneers
We will never end
For a million years

My back is to the wall
Come the ending scene
a moment still
we have until I
wake up and the dream reverse us

I don't care that you never knew me
I love you
and I'm never mad that you never see me
I find you
Every time you pass me I envy
The big blue
That we solemnly traverse
When we sleep and let the dream immerse us now

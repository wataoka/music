ブッ飛ばせ It's midnight
時間を飛び越えて To make some little fixing
To make some little fixing
Time to pay off your debts now
見上げれば Midday sun
To make some little fixing なぜかゼロが欲しい
君は flying hight
僕は in the air 揺れる
君は passing by 僕は out of space 浮かぶ
You and I On the way To see the day
That'll make the change

ブッ潰せ mean while
くだらない価値観 Pray for something to happen
pray for something to happen
The time has come for you now
見下して for A while
Pray for something to happen 期待なんてしないよ
君は heading to
僕は in a sphere 包む
君は Flowing to 僕は not aware 溶ける
You and I On the way To see the day
That'll make the change

ユラユラと The deeper you fall
ヒラヒラと The further you go
キラキラと The higher you get
水槽の中さ Cause everything that
you counted on was never real

君は flying high
僕は in the air 揺れる
君は passing by 僕は out of space 浮かぶ
You and I On the way To see the day
That'll make the change
ユラユラと The deeper you fall
ヒラヒラと The further you go
キラキラと The higher you get

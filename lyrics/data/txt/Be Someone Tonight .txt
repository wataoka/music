The world is spinning in my head
Every word I ever said
Going round and round
Screws me in the ground
Ah-

I want to be someone tonight
Ah-

My head is turning inside out
Every shadow every doubt
Going by & by
Makes me wonder why
Ah-
I don't know how baby but I-
I want to be somewhere tonight
I want to be someone tonight

I don't know if I'm coming or going these days
If we don't go soon we'll be going crazy

The time is coming now I fear
For us to get way out of here
Everyday I pray
That we will find our way
Ah-

I don't know how baby but I-
I want to be somewhere tonight
I want to be someone tonight
I want to be someone tonight
I want to be someone tonight
I want to be someone tonight

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddie
but if I do, I don't follow through
'cause my heart belongs to daddy

If I invite a boy some night
to dine on my fine fin and hati
I just adore his askin' for more
but my heart belongs to daddy

Yes my heart belongs to daddy
and I simply couldn't be bad
yes my heart belongs to daddy
so I want to warn you laddy
though I know you're perfectly swell
that my heart belongs to daddy
'cause my daddy he treats me so well

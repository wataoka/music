Oh Oh Oh (Everyone around the world)

There's a place where beauty lives
I see it when I dream
And when the mountains kiss the stars
The children come and sing

Oh Oh Oh (Everyone around the world)

There's a place where music lives
It's in the air we breathe
Where language is an instrument
We play in harmony

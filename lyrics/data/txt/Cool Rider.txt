Shine on highway, Rollin' right on
Speed and power, I got speed and power
Zooming like a rocket
Road keeps moving by me
Zooming like a rocket-man
Highway just keeps flashing by me, yeah

★Thunder and lightning, wild and free
　Bike flies faster
　Thunder and lightning, wild and free
　Wind blows harder
　Thunder and lightning, wild and free
　Come on power fly……

Feel my engine pulsing now
Blow on mighty wonder
Open up the throttle now
Sound like a big buffalo, yeah

★Repeat

Shine on highway
Speed and power, I got speed and power……

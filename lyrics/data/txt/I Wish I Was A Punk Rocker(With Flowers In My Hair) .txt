OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR
IN 77 AND 69 REVOLUTION WAS IN THE AIR
I WAS BORN TOO LATE
INTO A WORLD THAT DOESN'T CARE
OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR

WHEN THE HEAD OF STATE DIDN'T PLAY GUITAR
NOT EVERYBODY DROVE A CAR
WHEN MUSIC REALLY MATTERED
AND WHEN RADIO WAS KING

WHEN ACCOUNTANTS DIDN'T HAVE CONTROL
THE MEDIA COULDN'T BUY YOUR SOUL
WHEN COMPUTERS WERE STILL SCARY
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW EVERYTHING

OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR
IN 77 AND 69 REVOLUTION WAS IN THE AIR
I WAS BORN TOO LATE
INTO A WORLD THAT DOESN'T CARE
OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR

WHEN POP STARS STILL REAMINED A MYTH
AND IGNORANCE COULD STILL BE BLISS
AND WHEN GOD SAVED THE QUEEN
SHE TURNED A WHITER SHADE OF PALE
MY MUM AND DAD WERE IN THEIR TEENS
ANARCHY WAS STILL A DREAM
AND THE ONLY WAY TO STAY IN TOUCH
WAS A LETTER IN THE MAIL

OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR
IN 77 AND 69 REVOLUTION WAS IN THE AIR
I WAS BORN TOO LATE
INTO A WORLD THAT DOESN'T CARE
OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR

WHEN RECORD SHOPS WERE STILL ON TOP
AND VINLY WAS ALL THAT THEY STOCKED
AND THE SUPER INFO HIGHWAY
WAS STILL DRIFTING OUT IN SPACE
KIDS WERE WEARING HAND ME DOWNS
PLAYING GAMES MEANT KICK AROUNDS
AND FOOTBALLERS STILL HAD LONG HAIR
WITH DIRT ACROSS THEIR FACE

OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR
IN 77 AND 69 REVOLUTION WAS IN THE AIR
I WAS BORN TOO LATE
INTO A WORLD THAT DOESN'T CARE
OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR

I WAS BORN TOO LATE
INTO A WORLD THAT DOESN'T CARE
OH I WISH I WAS A PUNK ROCKER WITH FLOWERS IN MY HAIR

I'm with you
But sometimes your heart is not with me
I'm with you
But sometimes I can't see
I'm with you all day long
But you're thinking about somebody whom I don't care
Yes, I care

I hear you
You sound like you do not what to share
I hear you
looking for a chance to run
I hear you I hear you all
You are thinking about something
which you'll never get back

Too scared to ask you
Love you much too much
Too weak to say that I don't need you no more
”Are you sure you're with the one you love?”
You'll never know never till the pain

I'm with you
whatever you say, I'm with you
I hurt you and you hurt me
This is just how we are
Tried to stop this and let you go
But there's something about you
to touch me and hold me back

Too scared to ask you
Love you much too much
Too weak to say that I don't need you no more
”I'm you sure you're with the one you love?”
You'll never know never till the pain

I'm with you
Are you with me?
Are you sure?
Are you sure?

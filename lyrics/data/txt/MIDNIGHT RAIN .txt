I need your loving
Beside me, here in my arms
Don't ever go away
I just need you to stay
Don't say that it's too late, love in vain

I know I hurt you
And I'm sorry like never before
Had I listened to my heart
Our love would remain
Though it was my own mistake, love in pain

Midnight rain, you left me in the rain
Midnight rain, though I'm the one to blame
Darling can't you see, I need you in my life
Please don't put out the flame
Keep it burning till forever midnight rain

Make it up to you, I swear that I will
I'm not ashamed to cry, I need you near me
Can you hear me, in the rain
Ooh rain, midnight rain

Oh baby don't go without me
I promise you'll see
It's not like before
Please let me hear you say
That you'll come back to stay, no more pain

Midnight rain, you left me in the rain
Midnight rain, though I'm the one to blame
Darling can't you see, I need you in my life
Please don't put out the flame
Keep it burning till forever midnight rain

Make it up to you, I swear that I will
I'm not ashamed to cry, I need you near me
Can you hear me, in the rain
Ooh rain, midnight rain

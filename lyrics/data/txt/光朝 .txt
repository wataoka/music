受話器の向こうから 聞こえる君の声
やさしく届く 静かにゆっくり過ぎる夜
今この時にも 深い悲しみの波紋が、
わかってるけれど 汚してきた足跡でしょ
The mind is always set to drive and reach for higher things.
Remember the days just to forget the days,
日々はただ過ぎてゆく。.

Let's give it all back, walk a new track
移り変わる 次の世界へ
Don't ya want to see it?
A beautiful morning, 扉開いて。
Now give it all back walk a new track,
Live a new day, 未来の子供たちへ
美しい朝を この世界へ。

How many times we've told the tale,
Our parts are played right on T.V.
C'mon and change the channel please,
I don't care to ever watch this scene again,
fast forward to the end, or play the first part again.

昨日までの事、決して忘れないで。
Lay down just for a while,
I'm thinking it's such a small price to pay.

The mind is set on overdive to reach for higher things.
Remember the days don't ya forget to change,
Our whole lives will live on through time.

Let's give it all back, walk a new track
移り変わる 次の世界へ
Don't ya want to see it?
A beautiful morning, 扉開いて。
Now give it all back walk a new track,
Live a new day, 未来の子供達へ
美しい朝を この世界へ。

Tick tock the clock has lost it's time,
Nobody's got to worry now,
The night's sublime like fireworks.
Oh no no!
All at close range and,
Gotta be changin',
“Cause something is happenin”,

Let's give it all back, walk a new track give and you take.
Everybody's holding down. Don't ya want to see it?
A beautiful morning, is right out your doorway.
Now give it all back, walk a new track, live a new day.
Your kids are going to recall from now,
Whatever you were thinking about,
Your time is closing in.

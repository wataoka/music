You walked into the room like
Some kind of mystery
I thought you'd dance forever
Midnight fantasy
I know you're with somebody
Well I got someone too baby
But I can't help myself
And baby you don't want me to

You feel it, I know it
I see it in your eyes
Don't try to control it
Oh, baby you can't disguise no

Like thunder rollin' through the night
Girl I only wanna hold you tight
Whatcha think I'm too blind to see
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me
Shake your body so criminal
I see you tryin' but you can't let go
Baby we could take a fantasy
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me

I'm caught up in your rhythm
Lost within your touch
Moves so hypnotizin'
This could be dangerous
I don't care where you take me
Just take me there
And if I'm dreamin' don't wake me
Baby take this if you dare

You feel it, I know it
It's so electric baby
You want this, admit it
You're so addicted to it

Like thunder rollin' through the night
Girl I only wanna hold you tight
Whatcha think I'm too blind to see
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me
Shake your body so criminal
I see you tryin' but you can't let go
Baby we could take a fantasy
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me

Every night's a lifetime
Without you here
And till you're by my side, baby
Time is standin' still and oh
I've been watchin' you
And I can't help but notice
You want it, I know it
Baby you can't lie to me

Like thunder rollin' through the night
Girl I only wanna hold you tight
Whatcha think I'm too blind to see
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me
Shake your body so criminal
I see you tryin' but you can't let go
Baby we could take a fantasy
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me

Like thunder rollin' through the night
Girl I only wanna hold you tight
Whatcha think I'm too blind to see
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me
Shake your body so criminal
I see you tryin' but you can't let go
Baby we could take a fantasy
Don't lie to me, Don't lie to me

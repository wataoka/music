Well you got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
But hey, babe, your hair's all right
Hey, babe, let's stay out tonight
You lured me and I like it more
We love dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they play it hard
You want more and you want it first
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You're tacky, babe, you put them on

You're a rebel, rebel, you're torn your dress
Rebel, rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel. rebel, how could they know
Hot tramp, I love you so

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough
But enough ain't the test
You got your transmission and your live wire
You got your fuel line and half of the loot
You can't be there
When they count out the dues
'Cause you've torn your dress
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know
I said how could they know

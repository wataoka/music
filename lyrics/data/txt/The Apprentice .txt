It's never been this long
Maybe leaving was wrong
Countin' the minutes
Can't admit it that I'm in it for the long haul
I know I missed a lot
And every telephone call had me thinking of what I forget
What I know now, I still knew then
Yet I keep making the same mistakes all over again
So I turn around at the speed of sound

I've seen so many faces baby
Walking all around the world
But there's still so many places maybe
That I haven't seen before
I just can't believe it, how we never met before
If only I could see ya screaming
I'd do my best to hunt you out

I see the crowd
Reach out your hand
I got you on a life line, never gonna let you go

Let you go
Let you go
I will never let you go
Let you know
Let you know
I just need to let you know
Let you go
Let you go
I will never let you go
Let you know
Let you know

Are you feeling like a rock star?
Fancy!
Put your sunglasses on
You're on the cover of a magazine
Keep the cam flashing on
I bet you can't believe it
Singing in front of a crowd
Here's your new life now
I guess“what goes around comes around”

I see the crowd
Reach out your hand
It's your last life line
You're never gonna make it love

Let you go
Let you go
I will never let you go
Let you know
Let you know
I just need to let you know
Let you go
Let you go
I will never let you go
Let you know
Let you know

How could I have been so wrong
Had you singing this song
Maybe the minutes counted
But can a person believe enough to really mean it
Is it credible?
Another hour glass
How did I let all these feelings and memories, and years pass?
What I know now, I still knew then
Yet I keep making the same mistakes all over again
So I turn around at the speed of sound

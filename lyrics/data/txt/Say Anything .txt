Breathe in my truth
Won't stop loving you, no
Something sad about love in any era
But I'll be waiting, right here
I ain't done with you, no

Nothing seems to be the way it used to be
When you are not around

Nothing walks away
When I'm surrounded with love
Love is like a river
Flow slow into the sea

Nothing turns away
When I truly believe peace and love
Love can last forever
The forgiver and the forgiven
Both can get it

Love is like a river
Flow slow into the sea
Love can last forever
The forgiver and the forgiven
Both can get it

Like the way I love you
I want to love everything
Throw love into the river
Which never says anything

Like the way I love you
I want to love everything
Love can last forever
The forgiver and the forgiven
Both can get it

Like the way I love you
I want to love everything
Throw love into the river
Which never says anything

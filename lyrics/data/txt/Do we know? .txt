You still just don't know, You've given up, on what we know
You still really don't know, Shine the light, turn bright the night
You still, I don't know, You call me up, let's talk it through
You see that you don't know, Now that you know, what do we do now?

We move but you won't go, We try to find the hidden spark
We shake on firm ground, We try to find what doesn't shake
Then we heard a low murmur, We try to find where its coming from
We put words to a melody, We hum along and sing a song

Full moon night, the stars come out one by one, shining bright

Do we know? How much we don't know?
Pocket of ideas, bursting at the seam
There is space to fill with dreams
Do we hold? How much we don't hold?
Rocket waits for take off, to travel to your star
(So here we wait, so we a wait dreams)
So here we wait, so here we wait, waiting to go

You still just don't know, You've given up, on what we know
You still really don't know, Shine the light, turn bright the night
You still, I don't know, You call me up, let's talk it through
You see that you don't know, Now that you know, what do we do now?

Full moon night, the stars come out one by one, shining bright

Do we know? How much we don't know?
More than one idea switch Turning them on and off
That's how we create
Do we hold? How much we don't hold?
rocket soars, and here we wait
For it to get on path
So here we wait, so here we wait, waiting to go

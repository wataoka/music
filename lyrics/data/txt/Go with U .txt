I didn't want to fight
I didn't see your side
Yeah, maybe I was blind
Should take my own advice

You say what's on your mind
If I get hurt it's fine
It's never out of line
Just a matter of time

But somehow you control my mind
You do it to me every time

'Cause I'll go with you
When I'm lonely and I'm reaching out for someone
And I'll go with you
'Cause I know that I would fail without you near me
And I'll wait for you
Yeah I'll wait for you yeah
Yeah I'll go with you
Just lead, just lead…off I go oh oh

I say to you good night
And you turn off the light
Just never thought my life
Was something I'd recite

You take me by the hand
'Cause I'm in quick sand
No matter what we do
We're stuck just me & you

But somehow you control my mind
You do it to me every time

'Cause I'll go with you
When I'm lonely and I'm reaching out for someone
And I'll go with you
'Cause I know that I would fail without you near me
And I'll wait for you
Yeah I'll wait for you yeah
Yeah I'll go with you
Just lead, just lead…off I go oh oh

I couldn't leave you alone
I'm just not strong enough or smart enough
I'd try running away, but I'm afraid
I wouldn't find my way back… so

Go with you
When I'm lonely and I'm reaching out for someone
And I'll go with you
'Cause I know that I would fail without you near me
And I'll wait for you
Yeah I'll wait for you yeah
Yeah I'll go with you
Just lead, just lead…off I go oh oh

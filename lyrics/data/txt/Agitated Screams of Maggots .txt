I'm killing the haughtily fly

I'm gonna slash your wound just like mine.
I can't hear the voices of society anymore.
I don't understand. You're all fine hypocrites.

Shout The Joy

Your song's drenched in blood and it's full of shit.
You can't shoot the silver bullet into me.

Shout The Joy

It's the Black Flag, motherfucker!

I wanna shout out to all the trash celebrity stars.

I'll rape your daughter on your grave,
I'll rape your daughter on your grave,
I'll rape your daughter on your grave,

I'm gonna slash your wound just like mine.
I can't hear the voices of society anymore.

I Should Die!

It's the Black Flag, motherfucker!

I wanna shout out to all the trash celebrity stars.

I'll rape your daughter on your grave,
I'll rape your daughter on your grave,
I'll rape your daughter on your grave,

Cold Blooded

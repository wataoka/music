We lost something very precious.
What do you care?
We always find the reason why it exists.
You know you love me?

When you hear rubbish.
When someone dislike you.
Don't lose your heart.
Be yourself.
It's most important.
You know you love me?
It's no wonder you like me.

You know you love me?

Why there are perfume?
Because they give you luxurious feelings.
Why there is the sun?
Because the sun keeps human warm.
Don't be timid.
Be yourself.

This old house
On the shore
Swear that I've been here before
It came to me in a dream one morning

I looked up
Saw you there
Through the window on a chair
Your golden hair was shining in the sunbeam

And I said, Oo there you are
You're my favorite star
Shining bright and free
And no matter where you go
I will always know
That you were there for me

In a boat
On the sand
You will show me who I am
I look for you each and every morning

Meet me here
On the pier
Tonight the water is so clear
Reflecting you and I beneath the moonlight

And I said, Oo there you are
You're my favorite star
Shining bright and free
And no matter where you go
I will always know
That you were there for me

Sharing all our fears and hopes and dreams
I will keep your secrets safe with me

And I said, Oo there you are
You're my favorite star
Shining bright and free
And no matter where you go
I will always know
That you were there for me

And I said, Oo there you are
You're my favorite star
Shining bright and free
And no matter where you go
I will always know
That you were there for me

This old house
On the shore
Swear that I've been here before
It came to me in a dream one morning

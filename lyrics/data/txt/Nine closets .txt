Nine closets in your mind, mind
You're not gonna show what's all of in your heart

Dropping little word from your fingers
Such a lonely scene just like a pieces of grass

Holding your varying eyes
Holding your varying world

I saw your face, pissed & smiling, crying
feeling down your eyes, staying sharpen lips

It's a warm nudity, so noble grace just wine red blood

Holding your varying eyes
Holding your varying world

Sometimes it's gloomy haze
Sometimes it's jealousy

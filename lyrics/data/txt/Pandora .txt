In the box the sun is blazing
Fuel rod that knows no aging
Radiates energy that mankind cannot tame
The point of no return Chain reaction done

Eternal fire
Atomic pyre
Power hunger
Abysmal desire

Arrogance of mankind
Safety myth crumbles into pieces
On the loose Lucifer
For their greed and deceit
On the rising sun, Black rain falls down

Nuclear wasteland
Hiding head in the sand
Is it too late?
Shall we blame our fate?

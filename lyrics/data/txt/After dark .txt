When the sun goes down I'll meet you half
Don't worry about tickets I know a back way
When the party starts to roll we'll sneak out to the flour
We can't waist another song come take my hand now
Dance with me just dance with me tonight

Let the sound take us higher and higher(higher)
Turn the volume up louder and louder now
Let the lights burn like fire like fire(like fire)
For tonight I can make you feel better
I'll make you feel

I'll make you feel like you make me when I'm with you
I sink in to your eyes like this I'll show you
When the party starts to roll we'll sneak out to the flour
We can't waist another song come take my hand now
Sing with me just sing with me tonight

You can feel it in your heart so don't think it in your head
Just come on take my hand I'll show you how

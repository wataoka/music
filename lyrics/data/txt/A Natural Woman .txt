Lookin' out on the morning rain,
I used to feel uninspired.
And when I knew I'd have to face another day,
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met feel you,
Like was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind,

'Cause you make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.

When my soul was in the lost and found,
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me,
'Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm lving for,
'Cause if I make you happy
I don't need to do more,

'Cause you make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.

Oh, Baby, what you've done to me!
[What's you've done to me!]
You make me feel so good inside.
[Good inside.]
And I just want to be
[Want to be]
Close to you.
You make me feel so alive!

You make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural, natural woman.

You make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural, natural woman.

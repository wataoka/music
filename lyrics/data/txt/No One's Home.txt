though it's all over
times i wonder still
“what you doin'now?”
well...
tears are all i ever get enough of here
without you in my life
without you in my life
might be time to lose you
just let it go
and walk away
ain't no use in tryin'
cuz you're too far away now
empty rooms that i can't hold
silence gets cold
no one's home
nothin' i can do
i had it all within my reach but now it's gone
there's no smile in my life
there's no you here to love me

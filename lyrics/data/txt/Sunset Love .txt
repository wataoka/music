Your love surrounds my soul
(I'll be there when you call, I'll be there if you fall)
Filling my heart with joy
(I'll be right there beside you, to hold you and guide you)

You are the reason I breathe
(I'll be there when you call, I'll be there if you fall)
You are the reason I live
(I'll be right there beside you, to hold you and guide you)

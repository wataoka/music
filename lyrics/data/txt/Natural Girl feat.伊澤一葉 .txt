I have to just say
I never met a girl with your way
Magical and beautiful, the way you behave
Soft and so true

And all that you do
Whatever little fancy you see
Its the way you hold your hand on top of my hand
Fresh and so new

You're so natural and you're so beautiful
You make me love the way we laugh all day and all night... You
Have the beauty that makes me spin
Around and round and...
Around again

And I have to just say
With every little thing that you do
You're everything I want to see
You radiate the sun on a cheery sea

And you're silk and serene
You're a cool breeze on my cheek
You are so natural, your beauty is
The way we all should be

Bop Bop

Whatever you see
Whatever little things that you need
You can always count on me to make you believe
In beauty and soul

And all that I need
And every thing that I see
You're the only one that makes the world go round
Weightless and strong

You're so natural and you're so beautiful
You make me love the way we laugh all day and all night... You
Have the beauty that makes me spin
Around and round and...
Around again

And I have to just say
With every little thing that you do
You're everything I want to see
You radiate the sun on a cheery sea

And you're silk and serene
You're a cool breeze on my cheek
You are so natural, your beauty is
The way we all should be

Natural and you're so beautiful to me
Natural is everything we want to be
Beauty falling all around your smile
Beauty spinning, its beauty all around

And you're natural and you're so beautiful
I love the way that you can make me smile when I so need it
Natural and you're so beautiful
I love how everything with you is always so amazing

Natural and you're so beautiful
You've got me running into circles, round... yeah
Fall in love with a natural girl
ooo... fall in love yeah

Gonna fall in love with a natural girl
Fall... you're so lovely, you're so beautiful
Gonna fall in love

i'm not too sure that i can go much farther
i'm really not sure things are even getting better
i'm so tired of the me that has to disagree
and so tired of the me that's in control

i woke up to see the sun shining all around me
how could it shine down on me?
you'd think that it would notice
i can't take anymore
i had to ask myself,
&quot;what's it really for?&quot;

everything i tried to do, it didn't matter
and now i might be better off just rolling over
cause you know i tried so hard but couldn't change a thing
and it hurts so much i might as well let go

i can't really take the sun shining all around me
why would it shine down on me?
you'd think that it would notice
i no longer believe
can't help tellin' myself,
&quot;it don't mean a thing&quot;

i woke up to see sun shining all around me
how could it shine down on me?
sun shining all it's beauty
why would it shine down on me
you'd think that it would notice
i can't take anymore
just had to ask myself
&quot;what's it really for?&quot;

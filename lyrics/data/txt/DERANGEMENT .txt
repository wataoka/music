I'm sick 自覚へAsk
溢れ返るLies
Can you see it? This feelings…
冷たく打ち付けるQuiet

To you who gave all to me
Will you believe me once again?
My this disease
Before killing you
I want to take back blank days

[GOOFY STATE]
Self-hate
I fall in an infinite loop
Silent, Escapism, Lie
Unchangeable rotten root

To you who gave all to me
Will you believe me once again?
My this disease
Before killing you
I want to take back blank days

Lost day never undone
It undermines me
君を離さぬように
Lost day never undone
It undermines me
Disappear before killing you
This[Derangement]

To you who gave all to me
Will you believe me once again?
My this disease
Before killing you
I want to take back blank days

[GOOFY STATE]
Self-hate
I fall in an infinite loop
Silent, Escapism, Lie
Unchangeable rotten root

Bottom of my decaying mind
The fact that you gave
Day of the change

Never forget it
Next loop means death

Lost day never undone
It undermines me
君を離さぬように
Lost day never undone
It undermines me
Disappear before killing you
This[Derangement]

痛みの向こうへ
連れて行くよ
離しはしない
そう 例えただの灰に成ろうとも

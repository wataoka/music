Further, Further let's go ahead
Cross over the future, right away
Spread out your broken wings again
Fly to the sky
Do you know that you're my miracle?
Do you know what happened to my life?
Go far away, far away eternally
Fly to the sky...

If it's possible to say “See you” to you
Wanna say every time to you to make sure
I don't like “Good bye” so please wipe your tears now
And look up generous sky. How huge it is...

Stronger than hope & wish
Can you imagine?
You have things that no one else can imitate
You should fulfill your mission
Don't forsake yourself

Further, Further let's go ahead
Cross over the future, right away
Spread out your broken wings again
Fly to the sky
Do you know that you're my miracle?
Do you know what happened to my life?
Go far away, far away eternally
Fly to the sky...

Baby girl baby girl it's a miracle
Girl with you everything is possible
Beauty ova flow ft swagger ova load
Anything u want just ask, girl u know
I got your back that's fa sho
U got my back n that I know
M star rockin' show
G6 girl we fly, Sun tan in Hawaii,
Baby girl let shine, let shine

If you feel “I don't know why” and wanna cry
Try to recall my words to stand up again
If you assume “I can't handle this anymore”
Don't let go, please retry to say “Once again”

Mistake is not a shame, don't be afraid
The fear is to stop trying, not struggling
“You” are only one, so don't pretend

Further, Further let's go ahead
Cross over the future, right away
Spread out your broken wings again
Fly to the sky
Do you believe in your eternity?
Did you know that you're giving to me?
Go far away, far away eternally
Fly to the sky...

No matter how hard it's gonna be
You can overcome certainly, I'm sure
Can change the world
Believe me now
Inside your arms
Future is waiting for you

Further, Further let's go ahead
Cross over the future, right away
Spread out your broken wings again
Fly to the sky
Do you know that you're my miracle?
Do you know what happened to my life?
Go far away, far away eternally
Fly to the sky...

Fly to the sky…

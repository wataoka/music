HOW CAN I TELL YOU

I CANNOT TOUCH YOU
BUT I CAN KILL YOU

I'M SO SAD TO SAY TO YOU
BUT DON'T PUT YOUR FACE SO CLOSE TO ME

NOW I HEAR YOU SAY MY NAME
SO I CROSS THE LIGHT
TO BE WITH YOU

WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR NOW

I KNOW YOU CAN'T
I KNOW YOU CANNOT

I'M SO SAD TO SAY TO YOU
BUT DON'T PUT YOUR FACE SO CLOSE TO ME

NOW I HEAR YOU SAY MY NAME
SO I CROSS THE FIRE
TO BE WITH YOU

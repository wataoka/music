The answers won't come to mind
Though I want it so badly
I can't seem to get it right
Even though I dream about it all the time

These things I anticipate
I strangle myself
Isn't this what they want
Isn't this what I want

Undo and undress
I curl up naked on my bed
Close my eyes
Feel my breath drawn into me
Undo and undress
I can feel happiness inside me
It tickles my stomach

When I start to doubt myself
A back hole appears on the surface
Shoveling daimonds into it
Endlessly draining, waiting for the lights to turn on

I'm feeling exhausted
How much more can I take
Making me bored and numb
It doesn't work on me

Undo and undress
I look up at the ceiling
Bare skin touches the floor
It makes me feel alive
Undo and undress
I can feel happiness inside me
It's the beginning and the end

Undo and undress
I curl up naked on my bed
Close my eyes
Feel my breath drawn into me
Undo and undress
I can feel happiness inside me
It tickles my stomach

Undo and undress
I look up at the ceiling
Bare skin touches the floor
It makes me feel alive
Undo and undress
I can feel happiness inside me
It's the beginning and the end

I'm losing myself
Watching you leave
Vanishing train
It's like a nightmare
We were lying
Tried to be deaf
As it all fell apart

I'm losing myself
Watching you leave
Disappearing
I must be dreaming
"This is for real
I will be there"
That I told you before

All through the night
Alone, crying out loud
But I'll come back again
Again

I'm losing myself
Watching you leave
Disappearing
I must be dreaming
"This is for real
I will be there"
That I told you before

All through the night
Alone, crying out loud
But I'll come back again
Again

Every moment counts
Swing from joy to sorrow
Going back and forth
It means a lot to understand
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
It goes

You're losing yourself
Watching me leave
Disappearing
It's like a nightmare
We were lying
Tried to be deaf
As it all fell apart

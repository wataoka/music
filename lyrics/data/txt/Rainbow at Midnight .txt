seven colored rainbow in the sky
I'm reaching out
tryin' to hold it in my hand
now I believe
it took me so long
to see it at night
in my eyes
in everyone's

how I felt the strength held in his arms
for the first time
we're together at sunrise
it's days like these
that I remember
and I'm wishing for
thoughts like these
take me there

if your brave enough to smile alone
then tomorrow a new day will dawn
I don't need my tears
unless they're tears
that I cry in joy
I believe
after the rain its fine
there will be a light that shines
in the sky there's a rainbow at midnight

looking back on the regrets I've known
and the pain of standing all alone
I embrace them here now
I welcome all that the future holds for me

leave the past
and let it fade away
follow that your heart says
and I know
that one day your dreams will all come true

what of all the words we've heard
and read
their meanings change
like a promise left unsaid
one thing I know
always remember
what is in your heart
is the key
it's everything

please protect the one that you hold dear
for they will be
all you need to face the world
one day I know
you will discover
when you realize
real love
after all

if your brave enough to
smile alone
then tomorrow a new day will dawn
it begins right here
when you see its the part you play
I believe
even the darkest skies
hold a hope that shines so bright
in your life there's a rainbow at midnight

as I share this dream with you I hope
you will keep it always in your heart
and throughout the years
it will be there
even in your darkest hour

there's no time
to say a last goodbye
who knows where the future lies
through it all
I'll be watching where ever you are

if your brave enough to smile alone
then tomorrow a new day will dawn
it begins right here
when you see
its the part you play
I believe
even the darkest skies
hold a hope that shines so bright
in your life there's a rainbow at midnight

In my heart the sky is never dark
nothing breaks the dream I have apart
and throughout the years
it will be there
even in your darkest hour

there's no time
to say a last goodbye
who knows where the future lies
through it all
I'll be watching where ever you are

through it all
I'll be watching where ever you are

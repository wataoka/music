Desperate Angel 
Fallin' from the sky 

Desperate angel 
Now you wonder why 

In a shitty town Lotta scum around 
Born into the world of make believe 

What you feel, no way it's real 
Everybody plays the game 

Wanting more than you had before 
Never gonna be satisfied 

Where to go You don't know 
How is your material world? 

※
(So won't you come beside me) 
Now you're gonna get it 
(Because you I'll set you free) 
Rock you all night 
※

Does It feel right? 
I am letting go now yeah! 

(Well they) sell me this
and they sell me that 
Don't want none of your fxxckin' crap 

(Got a) lot to say
do it my own way 
I will never follow 

Cannot change
rearrange 
I don't care no matter what you say 

Pay your dues win or lise 
How is your material world? 

(I'm burning, got the fire) 
I am gonna take you 
(You see you are my hiot desire) 
Show me your stuff 

Ready? Go! 
Give me what you want and more 

Desperate angel 
Got no wings to fly 

Desperate angel 
Sadness in your eye 

I wanna feel what's inside of you 
I want you so bad 

Forget what you've seen 
And forget what
you know right away 

I wanna feel what's inside of you 
I want you so bad 

I'll show you the way 
Then we'll sail far away 
Paradise through the night No!

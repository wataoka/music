Butterflies fly far away and hearts cry
Birds wonder why tomorrow is another day
Another day of missing you
Another day close to the next time

I wish I could hold you in my arms tonight

When can I see your eyes again lost in a spell
Take me home the place you know so well

When you held my hand at night
Before you went to sleep
I could feel the world between us
But you gave me said good-bye
Nothing is the same there's only pain
Living without you

I walk alone with emptiness beneath the stars
I just can't forget how you whispered in my ears
Another day of loneliness
Another day closer to the next time

I wish could hold you in my arms tonight

When can I see your face again lost in a spell
Take me home the place you know so well

Time takes the pain away
When you stay so near
Everything we fear will disappear
There is no where that I would rather be
Nothing is the same there is only pain

Living without you
When can I see your smile again lost in a spell
Take me home the place you know so well

When you held my hand so tired
Before you went to sleep
I could feel the world between us
But you gave me sweet good-bye
Nothing is the same there's only pain
Living without you

Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's Son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

tu tu tu, du tu

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's Son
swaying daisies singa lazy song beneath the sun

tu tu, yeah yeah yeah
Ooo Ooo

Ah, Mother Nature Son

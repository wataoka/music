雷鳴に震える空
反射してるビルの窓
慟哭はかき消される
生き甲斐さがす街

彫刻のようなmake-up も
普遍的さ纏う戦闘服
唐突な雨にだって
安らぎさがす

愛に満ちた場所へと
遠回りしてる

I can't take... I can't take...
I can't take my eyes...
I can't take...
I can't take my eyes off of you
in my heart

I can't take... I can't take...
I can't take my mind
All you've got to be is true
and in my heart

想像以上に脆い自信
無意識は軽い罪のよう
消滅を狙う感情
彷徨いゆくよう

夕暮れに手にいれた
静寂の中へ

I can't take... I can't take...
I can't take my eyes...
I can't take...
I can't take my eyes off of you
in my heart

I can't take... I can't take...
I can't take my mind
All you've got to be is true
and in my heart

Our love is like a sound
Too blind to see
It's called love
I can't stand on...
just a sunshine

I can't take... I can't take...
I can't take my mind
All you've got to be is true
and in my heart

I can't take...
I can't take my mind off of you

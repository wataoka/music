Sunny summer day
Riding in the sun
A quick vacation on a lazy Sunday
Meeting up with friends
It's not so far
To where the music and the ocean greet me

Running here and there
No time to spare
Always worried about tomorrow
We've gotta turn the tide and take it all in stride
Come on enjoy a weekend by the sea

It's another lazy kind of Sunday
A time for having fun day
Tomorrow's way too far away from here
Bring along your friends and all your family
The world's as sweet as candy
So good it makes you wanna cheer, yeahâ€¦

Everybody sha la la, sha sha la la, sha la la la 
Sing it baby sha la la, sha sha la la, sha la la la

Life comes and goes
Without a smile
You feel your motivation start to leave you

You've gotta stop
And look around
Let what's important in your life complete you

Live it up and large, take it all in stride
Never stop cuz it's way too easy
We've got an afternoon to give ourselves some
sha la la, sha sha la la, sha la la la
Sing it baby sha la la, sha sha la la, sha la la la

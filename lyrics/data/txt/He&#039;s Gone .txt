夢みたいね ケンカばかりしていた
海の見える
青い想い出の日々 揺さぶるの…
瞳の中 淡い景色すべてを
忘れたいと思う 私のハート ふるえてる…
出逢ったあの頃 この街
流れるメロディ なつ・かし・いね
夢じゃないの 低い声のさよなら
今はいない あなたの横顔
Ah Ah 浮かぶから… せつなくて…

Now he's gone
How am I to carry on
Cause I sit and I cry
All alone I wonder why
He said goodbye
Goodbye to me
Now he's gone
And this house just ain't a home
In my room late at night
As I hold my pillow tight
I really miss him now
He's gone

I still remember his touch
I need so much
Oh how sweet our lovin' could be
If he came back to me
But he's gone
And my heart is like a stone
I know I would be good
I would kiss him if I could
And tell him he's the only one
Too late now,he's gone

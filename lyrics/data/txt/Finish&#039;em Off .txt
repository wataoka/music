I'll go alone
No one can be in my place
Breaking the way leading the world into the dark
My heart was blown
Nothing covers up my sorrow
God, I can't fear losing many souls

You're wondering always
About life like I used to be
But when you choose the way as a soldier

Trust in me,'n'you can follow me
When you vanish into your shadow
While you conflict with your faith
"FINISH THEM OFF"
Count on me, or you can banish me
Over scareful bitter days
All of your scars will be your force
Fly high

If this fate cleaves your mind instead of your heart
Don't be afraid to realize you can be a slayer
Why did you grieve?
There's no answer you wanna know
Boy, you must tear the past up by yourself

When that moon is waning
You power will fade away
But when you give your all as a soldier

Trust in me,'n'you can follow me
When you vanish into your shadow
While you conflict with your faith
"FINISH THEM OFF"
Count on me, or you can banish me
Over scareful bitter days
All of your scars will be your force
Fly high

You're wondering always
Just like how I used to be
But when you choose the way as a soldier

Trust in me,'n'you can follow me
When you vanish into your shadow
While you conflict with your faith
"FINISH THEM OFF"
Count on me, or you can banish me
Over scareful bitter days
All of these stars let you
Trust in your days as the warrior
When you vanish into your shadow
While you conflict with your faith
"FINISH THEM OFF"
Count on me, or you can banish me
Over scareful bitter days
All of your scars will be your force
Fly high

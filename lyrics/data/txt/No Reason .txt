生まれゆく sensation
胸の奥は you don't know
一人終わらない愛の session
君だけが very slow

No special reason
No need for a reason
好きさあたしの own way

Oh, what a surprise to know
How I am satisfied, evermore
No need to externalize our sorrow
Of being alive anymore
Can you see me now?

君に揺られたい愛が fade
ただ受け入れる deep inside
いつかは愛という日に get back
さりげなくは I believe

No special reason
No need for a reason
行こうあたしの new day

Oh, what a surprise to know
How I am satisfied, evermore
No need to externalize our sorrow
Of being alive anymore

It's alright
Baby, gonna be alright
夢の中 the bitter end
明日へまた make my way
Can you see me now?

思い知る isolation
悲しみよ is it real?
そう time will tell
薄れゆく shadow
愛だけが everywhere

No special reason
No need for a reason
No special reason
No need for a reason
好きさあたしの own way
胸に刻むは brand-new day

Oh, what a surprise to know
How I am satisfied, evermore
No need to externalize our sorrow
Of being alive anymore

Oh, what a surprise to know
How I am satisfied, evermore
No need to externalize our bitter sorrow
Of being alive anymore

It's alright
Baby, gonna be alright
風の中 call my name

No special reason
No need for a reason
夢の中 the bitter end
明日へまた make my way
Can you see me now?

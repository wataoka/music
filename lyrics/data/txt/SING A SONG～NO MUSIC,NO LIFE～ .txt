「NO SMOKING」?
「NO PARKING」?
「NO DRINKING」?
「NO SEX」?
「NO KISSING」?
「NO DANCING」?
NO! I CAN'T
NO!! I CAN'T STAND IT!

I WANT EVERYTHING,
I NEED EVERYTHING,
AND I SING A SONG,
'CAUSE THAT'S MY LIFE
'CAUSE THAT'S MY LIFE
YOU KNOW, THAT'S MY WAY.

「NO FIGHTING」?
「NO TEARS」?
「NO CRYING」?
「NO MONEY」?
「NO MORE」?
NO KIDDING!!
NO! I CAN'T
NO!! I CAN'T STAND IT!

BABY,GIVE ME A BREAK!
I WANNA GO OUT.
AND I SHOUT, YEAH!
'CAUSE THAT'S MY LIFE
'CAUSE THAT'S MY LIFE
YOU KNOW, I LOVE YOU.

「NO MUSIC」?
NO!! I CAN'T STAND IT!

I WANT EVERYTHING,
I NEED EVERYTHING,
AND I SING A SONG,
'CAUSE THAT'S MY LIFE
'CAUSE THAT'S MY LIFE
YOU KNOW, THAT'S MY WAY

IF YOU LEAVE ME ALONE.

SING A SONG…
NO MUSIC,NO LIFE…

JUST REMEMBER
I LOVE YOU SO.

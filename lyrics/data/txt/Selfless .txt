The fire stareted long ago
A loaded gun jammed by a rose
Time's ringing in my head calls me,
Break, break my soul

Hiding my face as lonely make believe oneself
Somebody calls me
Don't destruct yourself like a shinning stars in the sky

I kept everything deep inside of sea
Mysterious space is in a crystal ball's reflection

I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
Oh starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna find a place where we belong

Real world used to be a paradox
Deep breathing myself right now
Let's feeling yourself, breathing myself just now

Real world used to be a paradox
Deep breathing myself right now from here
It's far beyond price to pay
It's far beyond yesterday

You can't see cuz' it's nothing

Cuz' you can't see it's nothing
Because you can't see it's nothing

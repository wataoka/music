You gotta 今気づく You gotta その意識が
トンでもなく広がって 駆け巡る
It's just a 途方もなく It's just a 沸騰してく
細胞の覚醒が 訪れる

聞こえてく今 Can you hear the real wonder
ただ胸預け World of new days
解き放ちたい Far away to real thunder
So now ここから掴み出す Rightway

Keep it, Keep it, Keep it, Keep it,
Just a Keep it, Keep it,
Now it's time for just the future stream
Keep it, Keep it, Keep it, Keep it,
Just a Keep it, Keep it,
今 繋がる On the stream

No matter 燃え尽きそうな No matter 愛情ならば
One more night 脱ぎ捨てて 取り戻そう
No fake またそこから No fake また始まる
まだ見てない未来重ね You & Me

どこまでもただ We belong to the truth
誰より遠く Break through the dark night
連れ出す君と Prayin' for the destiny
その手離さないで Follow us now

Keep it, Keep it, Keep it, Keep it,
Just a Keep it, Keep it,
Now it's time for just the future stream
Keep it, Keep it, Keep it, Keep it,
Just a Keep it, Keep it,
今 繋がる On the stream

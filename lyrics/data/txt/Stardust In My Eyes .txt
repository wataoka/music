Some days
As the light fades
It all blacks out

Wake up
In the morning
And the sun goes down

What do you do
You crash into the fear
Only you
Can pull me out the dark

And as we collide
It's like colors shoot across the sky
Bring me to life
Feels like stardust in my eyes
One touch and we disappear
Take me up to the stratosphere
Your love
Your light
Feels like stardust in my eyes

Can we live here
Can we die here
Till the stars go out

When you hold me
I feel happy
Don't wanna be earthbound

It's what you do
You crash into the fear
Only you
Can pull me out the dark

And as we collide
It's like colors shoot across the sky
Bring me to life
Feels like stardust in my eyes
One touch and we disappear
Take me up to the stratosphere
Your love
Your light
Feels like stardust in my eyes

Tell me a way, tell me a way
Tell me a way, tell me a way

And as we collide
It's like colors shoot across the sky
Bring me to life
Feels like stardust in my eyes
One touch and we disappear
Take me up to the stratosphere
Your love
Your light
Feels like stardust in my eyes

Tell me a way
It's like stardust in my eyes

I am just about to forget you. 
Once there was summer of color crimson lake. 
All it took to confess was a word. 
All it took to express was a kiss. 

When love was young between us. 
I wasn't too proud to wait for carrousels. 
You whispered you would make me a day. 
Like no day had been in my life. 


You let me feel I was turned on. 
You had me feel I was only one. 
You made me feel I was loved by the whole world. 


I never said that I was in love. 
You never held me in your arms. 
Never made love, we never dared to. 

I am just about to forget you. 
Once there was winter of color horizon blue. 
All I knew, you were there beside me. 
All I saw, our shadows on the path. 

I love you so, still I know I do. 
I trust you so, yet I know I do. 
I want you so, true like ice, true like fire. 

To keep my mind sharp and bright, 
To keep my heart cold and tight, 
To keep my love alone and free, 
I shall leave. 

You let me feel I was turned on. 
You had me feel I was only one. 
You made me feel I was loved by the whole world.

Your talking to me
Your eyes sticking on me
I get defenseless when you call my name
It cuts right through me
The way that you do me
You got me begging, boy I'm on my knees
The games that you play(darling)
Don't leave me this way

Your words abuse me
Your actions amuse me
I close my eyes, but it's all the same
Your motions hurt me
Emotions desert me
I feel so helpless when you walk my way
The games that you play(darling)
Don't leave me this way

Just turn your love around
And when you do, you know I won't be found
Someday I will make you see
You'll be the one to believe, that you're in love with me
Oh darling please can't you see
I'm burning, it's now or never Boy, do you want me?

The games that you play(darling)
Don't leave me this way

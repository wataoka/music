AM I THE ONLY ONE?
AN OLD TREE AND A LONESOME SNOW and CLOUDS, I SEE
I HEARD A CUTE BIRD CALL
HAVEN'T HEARD IN YEARS and SAW A LIGHT OFF A WINDOW.

THERE WAS NO SOUND, I COULD RELAX A WHILE
IT WAS PERFECT, JUST CAN'T BEND MY KNEE
BUT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS, REPEATING MISTAKES
LIKE A RUNNING MOP, IMAGES ARE IN MY HEAD

AM I THE ONLY ONE?
A MOUNTAIN AND A LONESOME WIND and MOON, I SEE
I HEARD A HAPPY LEAF
HAVEN'T HEARD IN YEARS and SAW A WARM GREETING GROUND

THERE WAS NO SOUND, I COULD RELAX A WHILE
IT WAS PERFECT, JUST CAN'T BEND MY KNEE
BUT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS, REPEATING MISTAKES
LIKE A RUNNING MOP, IMAGES ARE IN MY HEAD

FEEL IN CHOCOLATE SYRUP
SO SWEET THEY COULD BREATHE GOOD BUT
SO BITTER THEIR CUTS COULD OPEN, EVERYONE
FEEL IN CHOCOLATE SYRUP
HATRED OF MAN FELL DEEP INTO THE GRIME
WISHING THE SYRUP COULD ROT AWAY

LOOK! THE TREE GOT ANGRY and BROKE
NATURE'S RADAR IS FIERCE AND BAD (WATCH OUT)!
LOOK! THE TREE GOT MAD AND FELL DOWN
WITH THIS SOUND IMAGINE FOR A WHILE
A BEAUTIFUL SEVEN SEAS OF THE WORLD.

THERE WAS NO SOUND, I COULD RELAX A WHILE
IT WAS PERFECT, JUST CAN'T BEND MY KNEE
BUT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS, REPEATING MISTAKES
LIKE A RUNNING MOP, IMAGES ARE IN MY HEAD

FEEL IN CHOCOLATE SYRUP
SO SWEET THEY COULD BREATHE GOOD BUT
SO BITTER THEIR CUTS COULD OPEN, EVERYONE
FEEL IN CHOCOLATE SYRUP
HATRED OF MAN FELL DEEP INTO THE GRIME
WISHING THE SYRUP COULD ROT AWAY

AM I THE ONLY ONE?
AN OLD TREE AND A LONESOME SNOW and CLOUDS, I SEE
I HEARD A CUTE BIRD CALL
HAVEN'T HEARD IN YEARS and SAW A LIGHT OFF A WINDOW

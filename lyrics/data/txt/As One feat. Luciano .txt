(Japan)
What a nice vibe!
Crystal water, Sunshine, Blue sky, and your smiles
I can feel it as soon as I smell the air
That I'm right there, so let's prepare
You heal my pain, you wake my soul
You rest my heart
Baby, I keep coming back to you

Our love is so special, our love is so strong
Our hearts beat as one, as one
Our music is so special, our voices so strong 
Our hearts beat as one, oh yeah, such a beautiful song

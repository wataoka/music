Cloudy memories
Of the way it used to be
Search for answers I can't see
Looking back in time
All the images they tell me where I'm going
They guide me

Look to the skies it's a new day, every day
Feeling so confused
But I know your heart is true
Please trust in me

Flying so high up in the sky
I'm caught up in a dream
My fears they fade away
It's my reality
And now I know the reason why
I've got to make a change
Grow stronger every day
I need you here with me

I'm trapped in the dark but I'll never give in
I gotta break free, escape this endless nightmare
I won't stop

Searching in the dark
But I don't know where you are
Won't you guide me
I'm falling
Tremble at your touch
And I know I must return back to reality
It's calling

Close your eyes and just follow, you'll know
Pleasure and the pain
Come to haunt me once again
Just trust in me

Everything that we're dreaming of
You make my life complete
The smell of victory
It's in the air I breathe
I'll always be right by your side
I do it all for you
But nothing's as it seems
I'm floating in a dream

You gotta believe the power that we feel
It comes from deep within our hearts a promise
That we'll keep

Open my eyes I try to speak
I'm calling out your name
God bless the miracle that brought you here to me

Flying so high up in the sky
I'm caught up in a dream
My fears they fade away
It's my reality
And now I know the reason why
I've got to make a change
Grow stronger every day
I need you here with me

I'm trapped in the dark but I'll never give in
I gotta break free, escape this endless nightmare
I won't stop

along the line on the wall
linking to your heart
does it end if I pull the plug
how true in words

among the rooftop stains
buds sprout from the dust
I know you can live without me
whistle in the breeze

along the line on the wall
winding to the top
vines climb madly city lights sadly
reality comes back to me

Is it really me writing this to you
Is it the real you sending this to me

you said you're leaving this country soon
I know it doesn't matter to us
but somehow I feel so sad today
It's not about you going away

among the rooftop trees
sky is wet & grey
I know you can live without me
whispers in the breeze

Is it really me writing this to you
maybe it's the real but only a part of me
Is it the real you writing this to me
maybe it's all lies
but it's alright

along the line on the wall
linking to your heart
does it end if I pull the plug
how true in words

among the rooftop stains
buds sprout from the dust
I know you can live without me
whistle in the breeze

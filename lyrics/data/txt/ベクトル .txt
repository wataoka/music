Told myself for a long time
Don't do there
You will only be sorry
Told myself so many times
I just had to take a look
in those faraway eyes

In them I saw a longing
for something
Maybe I couldn't give you
Said it's all in my mind
"It ain't nothing"

Don't say that
Don't say that
Darling no
Don't say anything at all
Because I've seen it now
Can't pretend anymore
"It ain't nothing"

Do you know what I mean?
And have you seen it too?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know?
And I'll do anything
Just tell me what it means
Cause I can't live in doubt anymore

Do we try or should we
just say good-bye

If you'd rather be somewhere
that's not here
then you just gotta tell me
Cause there's so much more to life
than pretending

Don't you know
Don't you know
Darling for you
I'd do anything at all
I wanna be with you
but that look in you eyes
tells me something

Do you know what I mean?
And have you seen it too?
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know?
And I'll do anything
Just tell me what it means
Cause I can't live in doubt anymore

I wanna know
can you tell me
I wanna know
will you tell me
is it hello
is it good-bye

I gotta know
won't you tell me
I gotta know
You can tell me
is it hello
or just good-bye

I gotta know
can you tell me
I gotta know
Will you tell me
is it hello
is it good-bye

I gotta know
won't you tell me
I gotta know
You can tell me
is it hello
or just good-bye
is it good-bye

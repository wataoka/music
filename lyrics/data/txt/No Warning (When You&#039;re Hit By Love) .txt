Yesterday I was a fool without a story
Suddenly the sweetest thing has happened to me
I say, I say
There's no warning when you're hit by love
There's no warning when you're hit by love

I'm a girl who always thought she had a theory
Thought I was the only one who ever knew me
I say, I say
There's no warning when you're hit by love
There's no warning when you're hit by love

There is no one out there honestly
who more than me could be more surprised
But I bet you wont be able to resist when you look in his eyes

Since the day that I was born I had it figured
I was ready with my finger on the trigger
I say, I say
There's no warning when you're hit by love
When he walks into a room its like a vision
And for once in my whole life ain't my decision

I say, I say
There's no warning when you're hit by love
There's no instructions saying this way up
There's no label this is fragile stuff
There's no writing saying hot to touch

There is no one out there honestly
who more than me could be more surprised
But I bet you wont be able to resist when you look in his eyes

Yesterday I was a fool without a story
Suddenly the sweetest thing has happened to me
I say, I say
There's no warning when you're hit by love

Since the day that I was born I had it figured
I was ready with my finger on the trigger
I say, I say
There's no warning when you're hit by love

There's no warning when you're hit by love....

I still wanna be next to you
一緒にやって来たのは事実
Nothing can ever compare to you
It was you (always you) and it's still you

遠い道をいっしょに耐え抜いたのが
信じられない君のためこの歌 唄っているのが

皆に別れるかも知れないと言われたけど
We're still here together standing closer than ever before.
Hey yeah

I still wanna be next to you
一緒にやって来たのは事実
Nothing can ever compare to you
It was you (always you) and it's still you

I just can't believe it, looking back how far we came together
After all this time, baby you're still the one
that I hold on to every night

When everything else is changing in this crazy world
Only you. You know you're the only thing
that'll never ever have to change oh baby

I still wanna be next to you
一緒にやって来たのは事実
Nothing can ever compare to you
It was you (always you) and it's still you

I still wanna be next to you
一緒にやって来たのは事実
Nothing can ever compare to you
It was you (always you) and it's still you

Spring summer fall winter
Through the rain and thunder shower
御互いの手をはなさない
終わるまで変わらない
You and me and me and you
just the two of us stuck like glue
Committed forever like a tattoo
Girl you will always be my boo

皆に別れるかも知れないと言われたけど
We're still here together standing closer than ever before.
Hey yeah

I still wanna be next to you
一緒にやって来たのは事実
Nothing can ever compare to you
It was you (always you) and it's still you

I still wanna be next to you
一緒にやって来たのは事実
Nothing can ever compare to you
It was you (always you) and it's still you

No matter how much I cry
It won't stop
No matter how head I grind my teeth in my frustration
No matter how loud I scream
It won't be heard
It just blows out silently

What do I get from building a Castle?
What do I get from building a Castle?
..this lone castle

I take a bath to ease my tensity in the end
I make a cup of jasmine tea by myself to calm me down
I wonder if money can help me to sleep better one day
after the prise, fame and all that jazz

What do I get from building a Castle?
What do I get from building a Castle?
..this lone castle

They tell me to hurt myself
deeper and deeper
They don't know what it's like to stay away from insanity
they tell me to go as far as I can
So I sing to be understand
'til they listen to me
So I sing to be understand
'til they listen to me
So I sing to be understand
'til they listen to me
So I sing to be understand
'til they listen to me

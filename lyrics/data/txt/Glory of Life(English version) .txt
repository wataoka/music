There are times
when the world'
seams to fold under pressure of man

no one knows
'bout the tears
in the rain that keep falling on us

Need to feel that the wind can change
In the home of the brave I believe

We can stand up and sing
the love that's within us will conqer, in someway
Now we're fighting to win
so hold on to this dream
For the glory of life...the glory of life

Throw a dime
In the well
make a wish and believe it comes true

say a prayer
close your eyes
'n you will see all the wonders of life

I believe there will come a time
when the world starts to shine in grace

We can stand up and sing
the love that's within us will conqer, in someway
Now we're fighting to win
so hold on to this dream
For the glory of life

we stumble and we fall
we win and we loose
we welcome all the joy
and shed all the tears

so, this is my song
for the glory of life...the glory of life

We can stand up and sing
the love that's within us will conqer, in someway
Now we're fighting to win
so hold on to this dream
For the glory of life

We can stand up and sing
the love that's within us will conqer, in someway
Now we're fighting to win
so hold on to this dream
For the glory of life

glory of life
glory of life

For the Glory of Life

Please look back now.
And freeze！
See my eyes.
Please don't doubt me.
So freeze！
See my eyes.
I don't try to trick you
I kiss you.

Please look back now.
And freeze！
See my eyes.
Please don't doubt me.
So freeze！
See my eyes.
If you don't believe me,
it's good-bye.

I'm a honest person.
You should know that.
Did I lie so far？
Please remember the past.

Please look back now.
And freeze！
See my eyes.
Please don't doubt me.
So freeze！
See my eyes.
I don't try to trick you
I kiss you.

Who are you？
Why are you there？

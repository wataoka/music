Searching for themeaning
Looking back what's leaving
Falling down again you
Lose control so easy

Yet, the only reason
There goes one more season
Can't you see what you can do?
All the thing's that you should lose

Find what is the truth, life just seems so cruel
Winner, loser never knowwho'll finally be the fool
Just release your heart
Light it on, Alert
The one and only matter that's the story and the start

Notice that you are not alone

Yeah come with us now,
Break the wall down, yes we can

Fly Again

Life just comes and go
Tomorrow never knows
Stand up once again to
Walk into the world for you

The feeling is so new
Believe in what you do
Don't you ever be afraid in losing
That's the clue

Find what is the truth, life just seems so cruel
Winner, loser never knowwho'll finally be the fool
Yes you are not alone
Yeah come with us now
Let us start it on, here we can

Fly Again

Falling down again
We meet again my friend
Life just comes and go
But tomorrow never knows
Find what is the truth, life just seems so cruel
Winner, loser never knowwho'll finally be the fool
But you are not alone we are not alone
We knowwhat's waiting out there
We knowwhere we should go

Living in theworld is as he said
“Running like a rolling stone” we go down
The riddle and the rhyme is up to you
Feel the beat and this sound
You got to know You got to seize this now
Readywhen you are, we're always here. Off we go

Fly Again

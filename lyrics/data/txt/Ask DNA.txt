Gummed up, brain dead and can't decide
You can't pray enough, you can't hide
You can be cool or you can cry
Do it wrong
Not at all
Or do it right

No one owes you, no one's to blame
Save for bad genes or DNA
Ask your conscience the why and how
Do it then
Do it when
But, do it now

What's up sweet cakes?
Who's hip anyway?
Earthgirls are easy
What you gonna do lil' buckaroo?
（Hey you, better ask her nice!）
A11 you gotta do, happy fool, is ask your mom

No, we all can't be Superfly GQPhdFBI
You can pretend and you can try
Move ahead
Lay down dead
Or slip on by

When the truth seems so faraway
Buddha loves you and Jesus saves
You need answers for your dismay

Ask yourself
Ask your mom
Ask DNA

What's up sweet cakes?
Who's hip anyway?
Earthgirls are easy
What you gonna do lil' buckaroo?
（Hey you, better ask her nice!）
A11 you gofta do, happy fool, is ask your mom

Kamakamakama ask your mama
Super groover mama Dahli Lama

What's up sweet cakes?
Who's hip anyway?
Earthgirls are easy
What you wanna do lil' buckaroo?
Come on!

What's up sweet cakes?
Who's hip anyway?
Earthgirls are easy
What you gonna do lil' buckaroo?
（Hey you, better ask her nice!）
All you gotta do, happy fool, is ask your mom

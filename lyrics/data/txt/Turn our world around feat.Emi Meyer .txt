Here we are
all alone
by ourselves
a moon of lavender
above us all

Well this life's
just a stoop
my soul is resting on
before you know the sun's
on the run

Still i'm allowed to laugh
still i'm allowed to dance
all these little things
turn our world around

Sunlight lands in my lap
tellin' me to look up
this moment will last
if we don't go so fast
oh

Sunshine holding my hand
showing me that I can
make each moment last
we just have to relax
ooh
stay

Turning round and round and round
stadubiti dubiti da dubada

Here we are
you and me
as ourselves
nothing fancier
than a guitar

Can you feel
underneath
what's really going on
before we know the song
we sing along

Still you're allowed to laugh
still you're allowed to dance
all these little things
turn our world around

Sunlight lands in my lap
tellin' me to look up
this moment will last
if we don't go so fast
oh

Sunshine holding my hand
showing me that I can
make each moment last
we just have to relax
ooh
stay

Turning round and round and round
stadubiti dubiti da dupata

Sunshine holding my hand
showing me that I can
make each moment last
we just have to relax
ooh
stay

From that smile on your lips
to the moment we kiss
I know that I'll miss
the beginning of this
oh-oh

Stop running from risk
start following bliss
no heaven's like this
everyday is a gift
oh
everyday

Can we open our eyes
in time to realize
even black and white
they reflect the same light
oh-oh

Turning round and round and round

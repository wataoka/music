every kiss you gave me touched my heart
every word still ringers in my mind
still lights the way to go
the song I sing is all for my love

every boat is aiming for the shore
every seed is growing towards the light
my heart still knows the place to go
let all my grief show the way below

every tear, could be like rain of grace to me

I reach for the sun
and sing for the sky
wishing my heart could fly
down to where my happiness lives
up the blue hills
to reach in the heart of the rainbow

I leave this place and then I'll get on board
leaving all sadness behind
a brighter new dawn is breaking
I reach for your soul
deep in immortal love

every heart is wounded by some love
but every soul keep searching from above
we'll make our way beyond the hard pouring rain
just to find love

I reach for the sun
and sing for the sky
wishing my love would hear
anywhere your lonely soul is
I'll be with you
We'll meet in the heart of the rainbow

stretching my hands to the songs of the earth
far to the unresolving truth
my life is a mystic dream to me
I reach for your soul
deep in immortal love

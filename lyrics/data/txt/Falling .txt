The mission's only half way done
It's taken on a life of its own.
I wasn't sure how they'd make it back home.
I crawl when you need me to run.
I know you think that I can't cope all alone,
but in time I can count on you there.

A little bit of time is all I want
A little bit of luck to turn me on
A little bit of something else is all I want these days

I'm falling offways
Ain't gaining headway
Been left here on my own
A little bit of time is all I want
A little bit of luck to turn me on
A little bit of something else is all I want these days

It's knowin' that I had to change.
(I'm) lookin' back on all the days,
(But)couldn't find anytime, that's the way that it is.
It's hard to say the words I feel
(I) need to understand I'm still,
on my own,even when you are here by my side.

A little bit of time is all I want
A little bit of luck to turn me on
A little bit of something else is all I want these days

I'm falling offways
Ain't gaining headway
Been left here on my own
A little bit of time is all I want
A little bit of luck to turn me on
A little bit of something else is all I want these days

I said, I love you for the first time of my life
And there was truth in me
Something greater is controlling me all the time
But there's no fear in me
So won't you hold me tighter?
So won't you be with me still?
I've been feeling fed up
with waiting for something clear,
And now that something is here

Oh I think I'm living a dream come true
One more kiss and I will fall thru
All I ever longed for was you
I think I'm living a dream come true
One more kiss and I will fall thru
All I ever longed for was you 

So won't you hold my hand?
See the stars, they're shining, shinig
Close your eyes and cry, ‘till I say I love you

愛すべきものは現在で、過去のものじゃない
救いを見つけ出せるのか?この大きな力に
任せて出会った新しい朝 もう手放さないでいて
泣かせないでいて

Oh I think I'm living a dream come true
One more kiss and I will fall thru
All I ever longed for was you
見果てない未来に明るい明日を探し出せるさ

So won't you hold my hand?
See the stars, they're shining, shinig
Close your eyes and cry, ‘till I say I love you

ゆっくり味わう ことなど忘れて
吸っては吐いてく そして悲しむ
君に会いたい

I think I'm living a dream come true,
one more kiss and I will fall thru

Oh I think I'm living a dream come true
One more kiss and I will fall thru
All I ever longed for was you
見果てない未来を君とならずっと守っていきたい

So won't you hold my hand?
See the stars, they're shining, shinig
Close your eyes and cry, ‘till I say I love you

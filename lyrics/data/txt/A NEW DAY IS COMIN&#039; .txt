Oh baby, all we gotta do is dance
Sing it, all we gotta do is sing
Do it, help me sing the song now
Believe it, said I'm on the right track

Shake it, get up and dance to the music
Believe it, said I'm on the right track
Everybody sing together
Everyone is everybody's brother
Have fun and put a smile on your face
You just sing a long and dance

Oh, la la la…
We've just gotta hold on
Oh, la la la…
A new day is comin', just hold on, hold on

Oh baby, I won't tell you you're wrong
Move it, all we gotta do is dance
I'm walkin', talkin', livin', lovin', dancin'
Come on sing together
Just do what you can and this is what we can do
Let me feel it

Oh, la la la…
Now it's time for our song
Oh, la la la…
Oh, la la la

Come on, come on
Oh, la la la
We've just gotta hold on
Oh, la la la
A new day is comin', just hold on, hold on
Oh, la la la
Oh baby, all we gotta do is dance
Sing it, all we gotta do is sing

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone

While the sun is bright or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

Good bye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question
Why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be

She just can't be chained to a life
Where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost, at such a cost

Good bye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind

Good bye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Good bye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

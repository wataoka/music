Toe to toe dancing very close
But if leaving,almost comeouters
Wall to wall people hypnotised
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacrillgious act
It's finest movement and no heart attack
Face to face, sadness solitude
And it's finger poppin
Twenty four hour shopping in rapture

Fire Fly Freddie told me everybody's style
D.J.'s spending a time, in my mind
Flashes past, flashes Cool
France la Ce pas, flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shop
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car
And drive real far
And you drive all night
And you See a light
And I comes right down
And lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run
But he's got a gun

And then he shoots you dead
And he eats your head
Then you've in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat cadillacs, Lincoins too
Mercuries and Subaru
And you don't stop
You keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars
Where the people meet face to face
Dance cheek to cheek one to one
Man to man, dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow
Cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars
He's eating bars
Yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat em all
Rapture keep your, take a tour
To the shore
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train
You'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop
Do the punk rock

Back to back, sacrillgious act
It's finest movement and no heart attack
Face to face, sadness solitude
And it's finger poppin
Twenty four hour shopping in rapture

Well now you see
What you wanna be
Just have your party on T.V
Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars
When the T.V's on

Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have to hassle
With the human race
Sing Hiphop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
Cause the man from Mars
Stop eating cars
Been eating bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up

Dear Love...
Your charms alone are beautiful
Can you be my dear love
I'll hold your hand I'll hold your arms
'Til the end of time Will you be mine
This love is climbing over sunrise
Over the moon slides
So when the wind blows
I'll seal this love
Until the end of time...

Dear love
Your charms alone are beautiful
Can you be my dear love
I've come to know that chances
Fall into the sand
Please understand
You've brought the girl inside of me
Inside of me...

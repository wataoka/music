You're bad I know it
A sugar coated pill so sweet
One taste, addicted
I'll be broken if you leave
You say we're talking
Just one word would cross the line
Tightrope I'm walking
I know it's wrong but I can't stop I'm falling into you

Just go, before we go too far
Can't hold back so leave me standing
Go, I know that if we start
Can't go back there's no soft landing
This is killing me
I'm on the edge of letting go
Don't speak just go

Don't say I'm different
I know that you've been here before
But my resistance
Feel it breaking like the dawn
Your touch electric
I know it's wrong but I can't stop I'm falling into you

You're bad I know it
A sugar coated pill so sweet
You got me tied, tied up in temptation
You got me tied, tied up in temptation

I wanna go to a place where I can say
That I'm all right and I'm staying there with you
I wanna know if there could be anyway
That there's no fight, and I'm safe and sound with you

And every time I look, I thought you were there,
But it was just my imagination
I don't see it anymore cause I see thru you now

今でも気付かないでしょう　この静かな空に
いつでも思い出すけど　もうどこにも戻れない

そしてずっと心で　醒めてそっと気付いて
いつかきっとやさしさ　見えてくるように

What's stopping me? I get stuck again
Is it really OK? It's never OK for me
What's got into me? I get lost again
Is it really OK? It's never going to be

そしてもっと探して　目の前に気付いて
明日はきっと風向きも　変わるように
風がそっとささやく　蠢くのはこの大地
迷わないでやさしさ　見えてくるように

And every time I look, I thought you were there,
But it was just my imagination
I don't see it anymore cause I see thru you now

I wanna go to a place where I can say
That I'm all right and I'm staying there with you

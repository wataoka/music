No one will help you
So you better help yourself
It's the only way to win
You'll watch your sadness finally disappear
And everything begin
Automatically

No sense to give up
So give yourself a chance
Turn your world upside down
Let your emotions run as wild as they know how
Then good times come around
Automatically

Don't shed a tear
And let it tear you apart
It's easier to say than do
Let go your fear
And unchain your heart
Then the love shine on through
Automatically

And all at once you'll hear your heart sing
That's just the sound
Of the universe in harmony
Reach for the stars and let your dream
Grow up from the ground
And carry you to destiny
Automatically

And all at once you'll hear your heart sing
That's just the sound
Of the universe in harmony
Reach for the stars and let your dream
Grow up from the ground
And carry you to destiny
Automatically

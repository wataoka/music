You know my daddy dug gates for his whole life
And he never knew nothing more
Yeah and his daddy done the dig like his old man
Who had dug before the war
And though she couldn't have known till I was born
My poor mama God rest her soul
Like them I come out diggin'

Well I was layin' out wire on number 9
Now when she come down to earth
And she was talkin' real loud
All about how she was gonna save the universe
I went and snuck a lil' peekin her blue eyes
And words just aren't enough
She had me off and runnin'

Could it be that I got bored and lonely
Could it be that I'm just dumb and horny
Could it be that Lady Luck has smiled herself on me

She wore rattlesnake boots, a sassy mood
She had me laughin' in my tears
The most beautiful thing, so young and sweet
A little green behind the ears
She took me higher then I ever been
Lordy what have I been missin'?
Now she is all I'm diggin'

Could it be that I got bored and lonely
Could it be that I'm just old and horny
Could it be that Lady Luck has smiled herself down on me

She's smilin' down on me, yeah

Come a little closer
Let me show you how it could be
Spacy little cowgirl
Come a little closer to me
Spacy little cowgirl

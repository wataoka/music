君がくり返し大人になって　何度も何度も遠くへ行って
見守る僕が　眠れない僕が　くしゃくしゃになったとしても
君の名を歌うために…

I remember sitting with you
Underneath the tree of life
We listened to every fainted cry
Of the creatures there on the day the world began

Looking at everything that I've lost
And almost everything that I've loved
I'll hold them all tightly in my arms
Wondering where I am, so please tell me where to go

All of the answers you seek lie hidden in the sun
If I hadn't met you my life would've been in the darkness forever
In my wings are the powers of immortality
But by meeting you my whole life has changed
You give light to me hope to me strength into my life

All this time these twelve thousand years I know　愛してる
Eight thousand years from the time that I've met you my love grows strong than ever before
Words can't say of this time I've been waiting to share my love with you
I'd give my life, I would give you the world to see you smiling every day
One hundred million and two thousand years from now　愛してる
I want you know since you came in my life every day, every night you give light into the darkest skies

All these twelve thousand years
I've been loving you

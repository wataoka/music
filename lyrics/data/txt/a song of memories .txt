When you wake you will see
That I am gone and you're alone

Please don't be sad, all the sorrows'n joys
Will turn to a song of memories

Even those happy days
All the nights we've been through
They're just a dream to forget

Tommorrow will bring
Another day
Today is the moment to live

悲しい時代も 結ばぬ愛も
やがて 思い出の歌になってゆく

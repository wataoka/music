Sittin' in small space
Filled by smoke
Everybody choke
It's like stuck myself in a heavy jail
Can't get out of it

I remember you, All makes me happy
Always satisfied
You make me feel like, I can fly
All things go up into smoke

Drinkin' all night,
Walkin' in the crowd
Lyin' on cold bed
All the loneliness, Always be a friend,
Get keep growin' up

When I see the moonlight, Such a clear and true,
All remember you
When you call my name, When you touch my back
When the night you kissed my heart

I wanna be like you,
l wanna see this world like you do
How come you can say &quot;Later will be better now&quot;

Wanna hear you baby, Don't you leave me honey
Won't you tell me something true
Won't you tell me something true
If I'm something wrong...
Gonna make you happy, Gonna stay my side
Won't you tell me something true
Can't live any more
Ain't nothing but a dark... Missing you...

Such a fool, honey
You're my sunshine

I never thought you fool!
Colors that you bringin'
Daylight that you makin'
Always take me home

But sometime I'm lookin' into your eyes
Havin' sadness in
I know you've been hurt, I know you've been right
But don't know what shoud I do

I wanna hold you tight
I wanna tell you &quot;You'll be mine&quot;
I really need your love
'Cause my heart is cryin' out

Wanna hear you baby, Don't you leave me honey
Won't you tell me something true
Won't you tell me something true
If you so hard to smile...
Gonna make you happy, Gonna stay my side
Won't you tell me something true
Can't live any more
Ain't nothing but a dark... Missing you...

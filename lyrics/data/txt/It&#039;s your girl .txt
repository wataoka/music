this is ridiculous, it's marvelous,
how you don't your girl is,
dangerous, that devious is infamous, you know?
u heard of ravenous? there'll be saving us unless
miss scandalous i do request that i be no contest.

keep her line now, playa,
or get back in line now

it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl, it's yo girl,
she's got an appetite,
it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl,
she'll eat you up alive,
it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl,
she's like a dynamite,
see my girl's, not yo'girl,
so what you gonna do

she's got she going crazy,
no

you think i'm cuttin'up, your sexy, flirty,
tighty shirty, little, PYT,
you couldn't possibly be absolutely more deceived,
she had you thinking it was me but know it's you,
she livin' at your house but tells you
when the rent is due

keep in mind now, playa,
don't mean to blow her cover but

it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl, it's yo girl,
she's got an appetite,
it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl,
she'll eat you up alive,
it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl,
she's like a dynamite,
see my girl's, not yo' girl,
so what you gonna do

she's got she going crazy,
no

she's hittin' up that dude, all night long,
it's been the second time, the DJ played this song,
and then you trippin', like i'm hittin',
but she ain't around,
I think she might be in a corner
with him gettin' down

think you need to think it twice,
she wants to be my baby...
be careful is my advice,

it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl, it's yo girl,
she's got an appetite,
it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl,
she'll eat you up alive,
it's yo' girl, it's yo' girl,
she's like a dynamite,
see my girl's, not yo' girl,
so what you gonna do

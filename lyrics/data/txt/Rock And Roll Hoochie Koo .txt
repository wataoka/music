I couldn't stop movin' when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a band called“The Jokers”, they were layin' it down
Doncha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound

Rock'n' Roll, Hoochie Koo
Lawdy mama light my fuse
Rock'n' Roll, Hoochie Koo
Truck on out and spread the news

I hope ya'll know what I'm talkin' about
The way she wiggled that thing, it really knocks me out
Gettin' high all the time, but if you're not there too
Come on a little closer, gonna do it to you

Rock'n' Roll, Hoochie Koo
Lawdy mama light my fuse
Rock'n' Roll, Hoochie Koo
Truck on out and spread the news

'Squitas start buzzin' bout that time of year
She's goin' 'round back, said“she'd meet me there”
We was ballin' in the grass growin'  behind the barn
Now my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

Rock'n' Roll, Hoochie Koo
Lawdy mama light my fuse
Rock'n' Roll, Hoochie Koo
Truck on out and spread the news

Done got tired of payin' dues
Said,“Goodbye to all my blues”
Said,“Goodbye to all my blues”
Lawdy mama, light my fuse

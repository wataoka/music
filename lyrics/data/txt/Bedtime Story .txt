I can't recall the end of it
I can't rewind but read it again
I keep going back with you to the endless bedtime story

Long long time ago
I saw the beautiful star in the sky
Deep deep down in my heart
I knew it was something that I shouldn't touch

I wish I'd never discovered you
By the time morning comes
You're supposed to be gone like a dream

How come you're still watching me
How come you're still shining
Maybe'cos I need the brightest light to read a bedtime story
I can't recall the end of it
I can't rewind but read it again
I keep going back with you to the endless bedtime story

Cold cold wind of the night
Kissed my hair just to say good night
Slow slow grows the pain
Until I fall asleep with the light on

I wish I'd never discovered you
As long as life goes on
I know you'd be there every night

How come you're still watching me
How come you're still shining
Maybe'cos I need the brightest light to read a bedtime story
I can't recall the end of it
I can't rewind but read it again
I keep going back with you to the endless bedtime story

Make a wish, make a wish
Is it you? Is this real?
Something tells me“Catch that blurry star”/“Shoot it while you can”

How come you're still watching me
How come you're still shining
Maybe'cos I need the brightest light to read a bedtime story
I can't recall the end of it
I can't rewind but read it again
I keep going back with you to the endless bedtime story

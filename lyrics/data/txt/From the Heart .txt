Filled with hatred for all 
that they have taken from me
Longing for the days 
when life was still untainted
So pissed off
The one's that I loved most are gone
Took my choice, left me with the blame
Now I am trapped like a rat in this cage
NO!

I'm isolated in my lack of trust
But you give me something to believe in
When I forget that 
there is something pure still left 
in this world

Against all odds we stand as one
When you are lost I will be there
Straight from the heart with all my strength
Against all odds we will find the way

Just when I think that 
there's something left to hold on to
They rip that away too and I seek direction
But how do I start over?
CHOKE!

I'm suffocating on my bitterness
But you give something you know 
I can breathe in
When I am sure that 
there is nothing pure still left in this world

Against all odds we stand as one
When you are lost I will be there
Straight from the heart with all my strength
Against all odds we will find the way

It's from the heart
Whatever may come
Straight from the heart
We stand as one

Against all odds we stand as one
When you are lost I will be there
Straight from the heart with all my strength
Against all odds we will find the way

It's from the heart
Whatever may come
Straight from the heart
We stand as one
We stand as one
We stand as one

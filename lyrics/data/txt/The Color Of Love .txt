I was lonely
I needed someone to see through
I was at the end of my rope
I needed someone to cut me loose
Then an angel out the blue
Gave me the sense that I might make it through
And somehow I survived, with no thyme or reason
And now I know I made it through
The miracle of you

I know the color of love
It lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
It's in the image of you
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul like a rainbow
And the color of love is in you

Like a bridge over(over)over troubled,
troubled waters
You stood beside me(stood beside me)
And your love did not falter
Then an angel,the angel in you
Gave me the strength to trust the lord
would see me through
And that's how I survived,there's no other reason
And now I know I made it,through the miracle of you

So girl I wanna thank you
I can't thank you enough
For showing me the meaning
The meaning of true love
When I was lost and so in need
You opened up your heart
I needed you to comfort me
You opened up your arms
I couldn't face another day
You said don't be afraid
Your love came unconditional
It showed my heart the way

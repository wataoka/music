No money plus no love
Wont believe will not trust
Lets doubt but wont change
Who's fault? It's your fault?

This is our
GOLDEN TIME

No money plus no love
Wont believe will not trust
Lets doubt wanting to change
Who's fault? It's our fault

This is our
GOLDEN TIME

We will know but not now
We will know but not just now

Just now

Future is now

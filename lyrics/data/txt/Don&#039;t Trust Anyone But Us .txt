I called her up
She answered on the phone
“Thanks for the invitation, but I don't remember you”
“It's been a while”He answered on the phone
“I am so sorry, but I don't think I can go”

All right You go work I will keep singing my songs
You buy your house I will buy my guitars

Now I don't trust anyone but us
Nothing more to say Not to be superstitious
Don't trust anyone but us
Nothing more to say Just don't be superstitious
I am I am I am still fighting

I will never say
“I am dying cause you are not coming” or
“I am dying cause you don't hear me” or
“I am dying cause you are not here to see me”

I don't trust anyone but us
Nothing more to say Not to be superstitious
Don't trust anyone but us
Nothing more to say Just don't be superstitious

I don't trust anyone but us
Nothing more to say Not to be superstitious
Don't trust anyone but us
No way Nothing more to say Just don't be superstitious
I am still fighting

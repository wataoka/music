Come down with love sickness
Come down with young displays
Come down with many happiness

Come down with big greediness
Come down with old disgrace
Come down with one loneliness

We are busy as a bee
Do we have time to
catch the last train?
Now is the time to run away
I heard someone knock
on the door loud

Come down with big greediness
Come down with old disgrace
Come down with one loneliness

We are busy as a bee
Do we have time to
catch the last train?
Now is the time to run away
I heard someone knock
on the door loud

We are busy as a bee
Do we have time to
catch the last train?
Now is the time to run away
I heard someone knock
on the door loud

I'd like to see you over there, if you know what I wanna be mad about
I'd like to see you over there, if you can beyond the time, now

'Coz my story is made by myself. Who can stop my fallin' away?
When I'm losing, who call on me? Please tell me where is the end of the world

I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' for nothing you don't care but I'm rollin' alone
I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' ほら なんにも無くたって大丈夫

I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' for nothing you don't care but I'm rollin' alone
I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' そう 心配させて ゴメンネ

Ah 眠れない夜は ボクにだってあるんだよ
そんなに近づかれると 臆病に負けるから
叶えた夢のせいで離れた想い 取り戻せるかな

I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' for nothing you don't care but I'm rollin' alone
I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' ほら なんにも無くたって大丈夫

I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' for nothing you don't care but I'm rollin' alone
I'm walkin' and runnin' and singin' and fightin' そう 心配させて ゴメンネ

She don't live here anymore
Left her keys on the kitchen floor

She's the girl on the 94

Marble Arch in the pouring rain
Lipstick hearts on the window pane

She's the girl on the 94

She loves him
She hates him
She wants him

She's the girl on the 94
The girl on the disco floor
She's the girl who just wanted more

She's the girl on the 94

She loves him
She hates him
She wants him

She's the girl who just wanted more
The girl from the factory floor

She's the girl on the 94

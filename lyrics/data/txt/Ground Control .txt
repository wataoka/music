Hear the countdown I drift away
And I'm weightless in outer space
Outer space
Hear you talking way down below
I'm moon walking I'm letting go
Don't let me go

Like a satellite I'm falling through the starry night baby
A universe away I'm heading to the milky way baby

I close my eyes and I let go
You talk me down like ground control
When I'm too high you're down below
You talk me down my ground control

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Passing mars and outer space
You're on my radar but start to fade
Start to fade
Through a black hole and back again
A million stars all light your name
Light your name

Like a satellite I'm falling through the starry night baby
A universe away I'm heading to the milky way baby

I close my eyes and I let go
You talk me down like ground control
When I'm too high you're down below
You talk me down my ground control

Like a satellite I'm falling through the starry night baby
A universe away I'm heading to the milky way baby, baby

I close my eyes and I let go
You talk me down like ground control
When I'm too high you're down below
You talk me down my ground control

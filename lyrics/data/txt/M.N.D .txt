When I listen to music.
Music brings me a different world. That's why I like it.

It's gonna rain 零れ出しそうなときも
I'm gonna shine 踊りだしそうなときも
そばに 耳元にいてくれたから
感じられた‘I'm not alone’

Play back  Play back  Play back
止めないでこのまま聴かせて
Play back  Play back  Play back
身体が今求めてるなら

We never stop Don't stop the music.We never stop
We never stop pls turn it up ya.We never stop
Let's get together now…

Sunny day, even rainy day
理屈じゃなくて 不思議なチカラ
僕たちを包む

Play back  Play back  Play back
止めないでこのまま聴かせて
Play back  Play back  Play back
身体が今求めてるなら

We never stop Don't stop the music.We never stop
We never stop pls turn it up ya.We never stop
Let's get together now…
Music Never Die It makes me smile.
Music Never Die It makes me cry.
Music Never Die It makes me feel.
Music Never Die It makes me high.

We never stop Don't stop the music.We never stop
We never stop pls turn it up ya.We never stop
Let's get together now…
Music Never Die It makes me smile.
Music Never Die It makes me cry.
Music Never Die It makes me feel.
Music Never Die It makes me high.

We never stop…

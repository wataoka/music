Feel like a fire each time I go.
Feel like a ray of sunlight.
Go down the road on wheels of gold.
I got a dream at midnight.
Come with me. Catch a flash of light.
Into the heavens.
Come with me. Roll the dice all right.
Seven come eleven.

Reach out. Take it now like there's no today.
I've got to ride.
Fly high. 'Cause you know that it's the only way.
I've got to ride.

Around me now I feel the beat.
The smell of burning rubber.
The devil, he can feel the heat.
There'll never be another.
Come with me. Catch a flash of light.
Into the heavens.
Come with me. Roll the dice tonight.
Seven come eleven.

Ride hard. Ride it now and sail into the wind.
Run like a child.
Flat out. Go for broke and you can really win it.
Go hide and wild.

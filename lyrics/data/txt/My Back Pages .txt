Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We'll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

白か黒しかこの世にはないと思っていたよ
誰よりも早くいい席で いい景色がみたかったんだ
僕を好きだと言ってくれた 女たちもどこかへ消えた
あ～ あのころの僕より今の方がずっと若いさ

あ～ あのころの僕より今の方がずっと若いさ

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

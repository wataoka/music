You and I - touch the sky Each time I walk in your paradise
We are gods - in our love We have no reason to throw the dice
Hearing our destiny calling
Leaving our fate in our hands

Alchemy - between you and me
We unite inside all the ancient chemistry
Alchemy - through eternity
We will never part Creating the gold in our hearts

Everything's possible Exploring the myths of the universe
Nothing's impossible unleashing the power before we burst
Hearing our destiny calling
Leaving our fate in our hands

Alchemy - between you and me
We unite inside all the ancient chemistry
Alchemy - through eternity
We will never part Creating the gold in our hearts

Whatever we find secrets remain as a truth untold
cause deep in our minds there's a core in exploring the gold

Alchemy - between you and me
We unite inside all the ancient chemistry
Alchemy - through eternity
We will never part Creating the gold in our hearts

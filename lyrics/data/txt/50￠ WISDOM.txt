Come on
Let me talk to you
I've got a feeling
In my head

Oh, Come on
Let me walk to you
I've got a feeling
In my head
In my mind

Is there any way?
Is there any how?
Is there any word that John says?
All I want is true
There is only wonder wall

Bleeding
Turn on the light to find my needle
Bleeding
Don't have to be american heros
Bleeding
Rock'n'roll belongs to swindles now
How could I?
How could I?

Oh, Come on
Let me walk to you
I've got a feeling
In my head

Come on
Let me walk to you
I've got a feeling
In my head
In my mind

Is there any way?
Is there any how?
Is there any word that John says?
All I want is true
There is only wonder wall

Bleeding
Turn on the light to find my needle
Bleeding
Don't have to be american heros
Bleeding
Rock'n'roll belongs to swindles now
How could I?
How could I?

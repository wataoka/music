She rises with the sunset
She wonders,"When will this end?"
The world is full of money, full of money
She goes out unprotected
She doesn't listen to her best friend
It's only for the money, for the money, for the money
She doesn't want to be respected
Reality's her best friend
She needs the extra money, extra money
In the city, the town,and the household
So many things go unreported
So many things her eyes have seen,eyes have seen,eyes have seen
(Chorus)
Meet me in the hotel lobby
Everybody's looking lonely
Watch me as I walk in slowly
When your eyes meet mine
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby
This is not what she expected
Her hopes,they stretch and they bend
Wrinkle like paper money, paper money
In the city, the town,and the household
So many things can be distorted
So if you want a true life story,bring money,bring money
Chorus(2Ã—)

She's unprotected
She's unprotected,oh
She's unprotected
She's unprotected,oh
Chorus
Meet me in the hotel lobby
Everybody's looking lonely

Catch me because I think I'm falling
I'll be waiting in the mirrors of the hotel lobby

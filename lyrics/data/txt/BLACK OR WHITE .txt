Acting just for self-content You're like a foolish puppet
Feel like someone's controlling me
My treasure and even my fateful encounter
I hate myself getting suspicious
Because of your expected kindness into this rusty world
“There is smoke without fire here”
Every small story is colored into a dramatic drama
Are you ready? P.P.R.Z

I'm readyさぁ始めようか I gotta go to the next stage
Watch me Watching you 君らじゃUnbreakable
What the hell is justice? What the hell is guilty?
Do you have the right to break it all up? Black or white
もうUnstoppable So unbreakable
But if you have the liberty Where is mine? Black or white
I'm not gonna hide or run away We are ready
つけようかBlack or white

Hey, Mr. Hypocrite! What do you want from me?
What can I believe? What can I love? You can't love anything
No one will ever believe you You can't take anything away from me
Because I have everyone on my side Cuz I have someone who loves me
It's my turn now
I'll sing this song for you-with all of my love
For the poor creatures You can find everything you've lost
Are you ready? P.P.R.Z

I'm readyさぁ始めようか I gotta go to the next stage
Watch me Watching you 君らじゃUnbreakable
What the hell is justice? What the hell is guilty?
Do you have the right to break it all up? Black or white
もうUnstoppable So unbreakable
But if you have the liberty Where is mine? Black or white
I'm not gonna hide or run away We are ready
つけようかBlack or white

形あるモノはNever Foreverって言うならMy heart
そこにあるLove chain and songはNobody takes Nobody breaks
I will hold onto that

I'm readyさぁ始めようか I gotta go to the next stage
Watch me Watching you 君らじゃUnbreakable
What the hell is justice? What the hell is guilty?
Do you have the right to break it all up? Black or white
もうUnstoppable So unbreakable
But if you have the liberty Where is mine? Black or white
I'm not gonna hide or run away We are ready
つけようかBlack or white

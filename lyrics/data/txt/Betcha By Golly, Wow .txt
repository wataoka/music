There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Can be read, appears each time you smile
With a thought like fairy tales come true
But they come true
When I'm near you
You're a genic in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise
And
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
If I could, I'd catch a falling star
To shine on you
So I'll know where you are
Put a rainbow in your favorite shades
To show I love you
Thinking of you
Write your name across the sky
Anything you ask, I'll try 'Cause

Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong.....

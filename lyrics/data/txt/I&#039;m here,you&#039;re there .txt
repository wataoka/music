I'm here
you're there
that's too far
I miss you
where do
we go from here?
right over there

Our picture imperfect the romance is gone
or maybe it's just that it wasn't even here all along
(wasn't even here all along)
I think I've got the puzzle no peace
nothing but oceans between
it seems to me I need a ship to navigate this sea
can you hear me scream
Where in the world are you??
(Where in the world are you???)

I'm here
you're there
that's too far
I miss you
where do
we go from here?

the lights on
I'm home
but so alone
I miss you
where do
we go from here
right over there

たとえどんなに遠くはなれたって
君との景色が変わったって
「じゃあね」「元気でね」
いつもの笑顔で強がって
でも
僕がいなくて大丈夫かなぁ?
泣いてる君は見たくないなぁ
んん、、
そんなの無理だよね?
泣いてしまうよね?
ずっと隣にいたいのが本音。
君の心が「ポキッ」と折れる
小さな音が聞き取れる距離に....いたいよ

I'm here
you're there
that's too far
I miss you
where do
we go from here?

And all these oceans of emotions
they comfort me and I don't know
how I'll sleep tonight
会いたい人にすぐ会えないと
世界は狭いと思えない

I'm here
you're there
that's too far
I miss you
where do
we go from here?

I'm here
you're there
that's too far
I miss you
where do
we go from here?

この距離の
意味を
探しながら
ずっと君を想ってるよ
right over there

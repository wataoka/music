You gotta jive to stay alive at night.
You wanna score before the morning gets you.
You're on a roll, you know what's in your sight.
You know you're gonna win if someone bets you.

Oooo you want to find a woman, get that lady.
Oooo you want it very much.

You've got a certain type of girl in mind.
And you decided that she's gonna like you.
And even if she's very hard to find.
it doesn't mean a thing because you got to.

Oooo you want to find a woman, get that lady.
Oooo you need her magic touch.

Until you find that woman,
forever you'll be cruising.
'Cause that's the way you learned to play on the street.

When the time is right, you're a winner.
Take her to your night,
'cause love opens your door.
Gotta treat her right,'cause she's a lady.
Love with all your might,
and then she'll be tellin' you
"Baby you're a man"

Don't want to take it easy wastin' time
'Cause life is getting better every day now.
You found the lady and you realize,
you gotta keep her so she doesn't stray now.

Oooo 'cause everybody wants to get that lady.
Oooo she has a magic touch.

Some people never measure,
just play the game for pleasure.
But that's the way they learned to play on the street.

When the time is right, you're a winner.
Take her to your night,
'cause love opens your door.
Gotta treat her right,'cause she's a lady.
Love with all your might,
and then she'll be tellin' you
"Baby you're a man"

When the time is right, you're a winner.
Take her to your night,
'cause love opens your door.
Gotta treat her right,'cause she's a lady.
Love with all your might,
and she'll be tellin' you
Woo yea, woo yea...

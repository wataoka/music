★tonight
　try to sleep, sleep won't come
　so I
　listen to my dear dear music
　they always give comfort to me
　sha la la la la la…for me

I saw you daytime, with your lovely friend
I tried to smile, you looked the other way
if I ask you why, maybe you tell me lies
you're so extreme, we are an old friend
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

tonight
feel so lonely, dancing with my mirror
and I'm
looking at the sadness in my eyes
now what am I supposed to do
sha la la la la la…for me

la la…

whatever you do, wherever you go
I have nothing to do with you, get a free
we don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
we never ever argue, cause I'm
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

tonight
I remember, time when we were child
and I'm
looking at a picture of one day
now why can't I control of me
sha la la la la la…for me

Div the Div the Div Div in your eyes
Zip the Zip the Zip Zip in the crime
かぶれて Spread yourself 目も当てらんねぇ
Damn If you could go back in time,....
Feel 過るSynchronicity 唯一のTry It's right in front of your eyes
Silent dignity Smilin' destiny Blendin' perfectly Just divine Yeah
傍観してるだけの第三者達 崩壊勝手 Do or not You どっち?
どっちつかずの迷える子羊 思い込んで Too much Can never touch
I miss my head how happy would I be
冴えたBrain なもんで千倍Bleed
Yea, Baby kiss my 断片 Be with this heat
Just Bleed for This Distorted Beat

UNDERSTAND IT! UNDERSTAND IT! UN?!

Plead:Be together
雨の賛美歌
歪む Again and again
単純なOne thing 不条理なThings
寝違えた Friend becomes a stranger again
You deal with cynics慣れた体 Magical頭から鳩でも出すみてぇで
Total chaos Hypocrisy Stop to bring the generation under subjection Damn
Un, まだChained at the knees 眼に映るThat boy's so shy
何故にお前 Punch out his light Can see in his eyes
So now, Just don't stay cool to get by
Try not to do so scummy Ain't no place to be
Blasphemy The way back down for me
Suggest Suggest Oh, Just Bleed for This Distorted Beat

UNDERSTAND IT! UNDERSTAND IT! UN?!

MARCHIN' MARCHIN' yea DEAD MEN MARCHIN'
半端なEmotionで Over the margin
Porno dub 残像 in your vision
one two, one two, one two
MARCHIN' MARCHIN' 憐れなMARCHIN'
エボニー製の王座 誰 夢見る主導権
Palace Of Bone 構えた Wide open walls
one two, Tread carefully
No policyの有権者 Hun?
Web pageでのポーズ 弁解の演者 Hun?
とどのつまりは お前らの表現の限界か
持論なんかの前に必要だ 真のMessage
UNDERSTAND IT!
Vanity production ただのProfanity
やめな その Bluff
UNDERSTAND IT! Yo, Men Of Culture Wake Up!
Yo, Wake Up! Now People C'mon

UNDERSTAND IT! UNDERSTAND IT! UN?!

it's been a long long time
since I saw you last
staying the same, all same
like the day you left

it's been a long long time
since I fell in love
I feel long long day
today somehow

float in your eyes
tears on the sly
sky in the pond
fades out

it's been a long long time
since I met you first
I was a shadow cast by your sun
everytime you looked into my eyes
dear, won't you come back again
catch me if I'm falling, so long

are you real real real real
do you feel feel butterfly

it's been a long long day
since I saw you last
fears falling down
and never touch the ground
dear, won't you come back someday
make the illusion go away, so long

it's been a long long day

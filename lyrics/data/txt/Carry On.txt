Look inside...
Everything you need is inside
And you'll find...
All you need to know is inside

It doesn't matter what other people say
No right or wrong
Life goes on...

You don't have to fight
There's no black or white
You know it's all right, just carry on
You don't have to cry
There's no reason why
Just look at the sky and carry on
You gotta believe
Believe in You
Carry On

Look around...
Look at all the beauty around
Every sound...
Like a happy merry-go-round

Remember, everyday is a brand new day
No need to fear
I'll be here...

You don't have to fight
There's no black or white
You know it's all right, just carry on
You don't have to cry
There's no reason why
Just look to the sky and carry on
You gotta believe
Believe in You
Carry On

You don't have to fight
There's no black or white
You know it's all right, just carry on
You don't have to cry
There's no reason why
Just look at the sky and carry on

You don't have to fight
There's no black or white
You know it's all right, just carry on
You don't have to cry
There's no reason why
Just look to the sky and carry on
You gotta believe
Believe in You
Carry On

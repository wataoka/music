踊る水平線上に 時は無く
蝕むサイケな色 誰のもの

でも I I I I Know Tell me why, Tell me
愛 愛 愛 愛 No? Can't you see?

Don't let me Down! Down! 先天的Motion Oh yeah
We going Down! Down! 混濁のAddiction Oh Oh Oh Oh
No more hate, No more tears Keep on, Dream on
Don't let me Down! Down! 交差してく感情 Oh Oh Oh Oh

走る環状線上に 音は無く
溶けるその時を 待ちわびて

でも Lie Lie Lie Lie Know Tell me why, Tell me
来 来 来 来 No? Save my soul

Don't let me Down! Down! 罪悪的Potion Oh yeah
We going Down! Down! 偏愛のDevotion Oh Oh Oh Oh
No more hate, No more tears Keep on, Dream on
Don't let me Down! Down! 乖離しては惨状 Oh Oh Oh Oh

Don't let me Down! Down! 先天的Motion Oh yeah
We going Down! Down! 混濁のAddiction Oh Oh Oh Oh
No more hate, No more tears Keep on, Dream on
Don't let me Down! Down! 交差してく感情

Don't let me Down! Down! 罪悪的Potion Oh yeah
We going Down! Down! 偏愛のDevotion Oh Oh Oh Oh
No more hate, No more tears Keep on, Dream on
Don't let me Down! Down! 乖離しては惨状 Oh Oh Oh Oh

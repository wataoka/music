You and I
In this world
Make a sound
Of a new life

A lonely road I've been walking all the way
This wasted heart has fallen every way
Did I ever find? The truth from yesterday
These worn down shoes haven't told me anything

Yet now I found something
That carries me again

It's not about
It's not about
It's not about me
It's all about
It's all about you
Be kind to me
Be kind to you
Be kind to this world
It's not about me

Now I know what really matters
It's one goodbye that means to all
Than thousand hellos that we say
It's not about

Too far away
We try to say
The things that please us
But they hurt us more
They pull us to fall

It's not about
It's not about
It's not about me
It's all about
It's all about you
Be kind to me
Be kind to you
Be kind to this world
It's not about me

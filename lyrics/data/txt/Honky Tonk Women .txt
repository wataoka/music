I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis,
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride.
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind.

It's a honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

I layed a divorcee in New York City,
I had to put up some kind of a fight.
The lady then she cornered me in Rose's,
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind.

It's a honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

(Yeah!) It's a honky tonk women.
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

(Yeah!) It's a honky tonk women.
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

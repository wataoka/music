I miss you baby（chorus）
I miss you baby（chorus）
Yes I miss you more than you know, oh babe
If only you could see me now
I'd go running into your arms
And hold you so you'd never go
Away from me again

Well I'm hooked on you for sure, oh babe
I never knew I loved you so bad
So give me another chance
Oh give me the chance to prove
How much I've really changed
I've changed and how
I swear I really love you

★You're gone now, what good am I when you are gone
　I'm lost, babe, with nowhere to turn
　You're gone now（but）what can I do to bring you home
　How could I've sent you away.

Alone I sit here in my dark and lonely room
Just listening to the city sounds below
'cause maybe I'll hear you come
Come walking in through my door
I'll sit here untill then
Believe me. babe
I swear I really love you

★Repeat

I miss you babe, yes I really do babe
I need you to be here with me now
Will I ever hear you come
Come walking in through my door
I'll sit here untill then
Believe me babe
I swear I really love you.

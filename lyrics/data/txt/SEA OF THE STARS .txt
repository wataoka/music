No need for crying,
let out your feelings,
wide through the space,
where time just endlessly spins,
twinkling tears of night,
darkness turns to light,
Sailing so free,Sailing in peace,
lay your heart down
onto the sea of the stars.

Struggling and losing,
never returning,
into the dreams,
of all the planets that sleep,
Rainbow colored stars,
gently taps the heart,
Dreaming along high above all,
Awaken now
upon the sea of the stars.

Life is a gift from above,
still there always an end,
Deep within hatred is
beauty of love that sing.

No need for crying,
you won't be lonely,
whisper a prayer,
to souls that endlessly live,
sparkling dusts of tears,
soon shall disappear,
trust and forgive,
Universe in back peace,
Rise now oh child
upon the sea of the stars.

What do I want to do? Where do I want to go to?
I feel like I'm dead
Since you disappeared from me
The lights are shining everywhere
But I can't feel anything

I experienced such a thing in the past
But I think the sorrow is even greater than before
You were irreplaceable for me
I can't live without you

Shalala…lalala…
Can't I hear your voice anymore?
Shalala…lalala…
I don't know what to do anymore?

What do I want to do?
Where do I want to go to?

Shalala…lalala…
Can't I touch your face anymore?
Shalala…lalala…
I want to forget everything

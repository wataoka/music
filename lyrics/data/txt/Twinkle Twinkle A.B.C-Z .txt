Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
A B C D X Y Z
Like a diamond in the sky.

I remember when we first met
And I saw a beautiful smile
I will never ever forget
Baby stay with me for a while

If U give me a little chance
Swear I' ll never make U cry
This could be a special romance
I' m your one and only guy

Girl I wanna make it together
And I know that you' re the only one for me
So can we make it now and forever?
And I swear I' ll be there everywhere
To cherish U and love U

Falling, U got me falling
And U make me happy, girl, in every way
Baby falling, U got me falling
And I wanna stay together girl forever and a day

例え僕たちが
すれ違う時も
二人の気持ちが
変わらないように

重ねた手と手を
強く握っていよう
そうすれば僕ら
きっと離れないよ

Oh 君の悲しみも
全部 受け止めて行くよ
My love 焦らなくてもいい
二人だけの答え
探しにいこう

Falling, U got me falling
時を重ねてく1, 2, 3
Baby, Falling, U got me falling
いつまでもそばにいてABC & Z

Can' t believe it' s true (Can' t believe it' s true)
Cause baby no-one makes me feel like U do
Destiny (Destiny), we' re meant to be (we' re meant to be)
ABC&amp;Z
Wow

Falling, U got me falling
And U make me happy, girl, in every way
Baby falling, U got me falling
And I wanna stay together every day

Falling, U got me falling
And U make me happy, girl, in every way
Baby falling, U got me falling
And I wanna stay together every day

Falling, U got me falling
And U make me happy, girl, in every way
Baby falling, U got me falling
And I wanna stay together every day

Falling, U got me falling

It's swallowed up in the dark dark dark
You are swallowed up
that love
that hate
that past
that pain
and you know yourself

I found between 0 and 1
That's my name it's lost in everything
but you know
You understand my feeling
例えば僕がキミなら
きっとこんな風に
I said it's not that I love you
but you love me
because I love you

It's swallowed up in the dark dark dark
You are swallowed up
that love
that hate
that past
that pain
and you know yourself
yourself

これは誰の顔だ?
僕の形はまるで不確かで
疑わしくて
やっぱ僕がキミでも
きっとこんな風に
I said it's not that I need you
but you need me
because I need you

It's swallowed up in the dark dark dark
You are swallowed up
that love
that hate
that past
that pain
and you know yourself
yourself

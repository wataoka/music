I woke up in a terrible spiral of the night
If I keep on sticking here, I'll be so mad
Waiting for the brand new day
But I cannot help going out
If you're feeling same as mine
Let's trip out with me now

I want to fly away with you
Today, tonight, be by your side

光目指して東の街へ
胸を焦がし wake up in the sun
今この身を追い風に任せ
星を頼って西の空へ
心癒し time to say goodnight
君を想ってまた朝陽を待つ

どこまで飛べば can we find our goals?
瞳に景色を焼き付けるように
僕らの過去も未来も現在も take it all
全てを詰め込んで今旅に出よう

I can't go back that way
Because today is the day of our new lives

心燃やして南の街へ
砂の声 listen to the sand
振り返れば夕焼けが滲む
風をたどって北の空へ
虹を描き dancing in the rain
乾いた夢 朝露にかざせ

Yes, I reach the sky
I take it fast, Make it high
It will be alright
The cloud has gone away
Just now is the time
Don't make it last, make it first
We'll be so bright
Don't ever go away
Coz' your my friend

I want to fly away with you
Today, tonight, be by your side

光目指して東の街へ
胸を焦がし wake up in the sun
今この身を追い風に任せ
星を頼って西の空へ
心癒し time to say goodnight
君を想ってまた朝陽を待つ
Lalala Lalala
夢の世界へ
Good night, good night
It's not good bye

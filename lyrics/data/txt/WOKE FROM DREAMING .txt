Woke from dreaming but it took convincing
I was shaking screaming I was still alive

And you were picking strangers by the side of roadways
Little little let the danger unfold

You can do what you do if you think you'll take it
You can do what you do if you are that way inclined

Suffer with silk as the pressure's tighter
You have skin pale as milk with the pressure on

My heart is getting heavy and my hands are weak now
Hatred lifting and I'll start to weep now

You can do what you do if you think you'll take it
You can do what you do if you are that way inclined

Just for a moment can we take a little time
Just stop for a moment can we make this moment mine
I've tried to let go but I've never had much to say
Take a day take them all now

Just for a moment can we take a little time
Just stop for a moment can we look inside this mind
We try to control but we never quite know what's there
We will kill if we need to

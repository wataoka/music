come to me
we never be apart
the sun you see is me

no more pain
no memories remain
now you can play with me

so love me now you are the one
I give you all the stars I see
the rain is gone no pain is here
my heart I beg you all your love

come to me
we never be apart
the sun you see is me

no more pain
no memories remain
now you can play
all the games with me

OH... OH... OH... OH...
OH... OH... OH... OH...
It took some time to dry my eyes
But I seemed to make it just in time
To hear you breathe the words,
"Baby, I want you back"
Weren't you the one who said"good bye?"
Was it not you who made me cry?
ちょっと待って But I knew this time would come

懐かしい You say to me"Remember how happy we were?"
But I can't recall
You must have got the wrong girl

抱き締めたい でも出来ない 信じれない
I just hope she was worth your time
IMPOSSIBLE
Nothing you say could change my mind

涙も無い 言うこと無い 許されない
Lies and fights, and waiting up all night
IMPOSSIBLE
I won't make the same mistake twice

いきなり現れて 合鍵突き返す
私よりあの女(こ)を選ぶの? Ah
いつまでも愛し続けるとばかり
思ってたけど そうも行かない
あなたの嘘とか 欺きとか
見て見ぬ振り 我慢して来たのに

抱き締めたい でも出来ない 信じれない
I just hope she was worth your time
IMPOSSIBLE
Nothing you say could change my mind

OH... OH... OH... OH...
OH... OH... OH... OH...
I'm not coming back
Never coming back

OH... OH... OH... OH...
OH... OH... OH... OH...
I'm not coming back
Never coming back

You took my hand and said you'd never let go
You kissed my lips and held me tight
You promised me you'd never ever leave me
Said that I'm the only one
Never again...will you touch this body
Never again...will you kiss these lips
Never again...will you touch this body
Never again

Don't come crying to me
No more 愛は無い

抱き締めたい でも出来ない 信じれない
I just hope she was worth your time
IMPOSSIBLE
Nothing you say could change my mind

抱き締めたい でも出来ない 信じれない
I just hope she was worth your time
IMPOSSIBLE
Nothing you say could change my mind

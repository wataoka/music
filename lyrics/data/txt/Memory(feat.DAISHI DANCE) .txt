I keep a bag of my memories
Here on the seat that is next to me

Watching every town go by
So beautiful the scenery
Everything I feel comes alive
Sweet tears fill my eyes

I'm forever with the memory
I see reflections in the night
Hand in hand
At sunrise
You and I will arrive
Memory

One photograph that I keep with me
Gives all the warmth I could ever need

Train tracks become a lullaby
Think back to how it used to be
Everything I feel comes alive
Sweet tears fill my eyes

I'm forever with the memory
I see reflections in the night
Hand in hand
At sunrise
You and I will arrive
Memory

The train will be leaving soon
I'll be with you
No there is no time to lose
I'll be with you
I'll wait for you in a dream
I'll be with you
I'm deep in a memory
I'll be with you

I'm forever with the memory
I see reflections in the night
Hand in hand
At sunrise
You and I will arrive

I'm forever with the memory
I see reflections in the night
Hand in hand
At sunrise
You and I will arrive
Memory

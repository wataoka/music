If I stall even momentarily
It takes me ages to get back on track you see
Although you've got me hypnotized
My heart is unnecessarily over beating

“Let's take our time at going out”
you said “just wait and see”
I wonder now if you had ever felt the same as me
I fell deeper and you grew tired of me
and we never said a thing about it

Our situation will go down some day in history

Fall back 'cause I'm running away from the attack
and I'm waiting to get on track

I needed you closer
You pushed me even farther
I found out something about me that I never knew before

The harder I get hit the harder I just wanna fall
It didn't matter if it hurt you see I wanted all to fall in place
‘cause in the end I was willing to do whatever it took to keep you

Our situation will go down some day in history

Fall back 'cause I'm running away from the attack
and I'm waiting to get on track

My position in this situation puts me in submission.
I've been locked down before, this ain't a hallucination.
I liked her, she liked me, and now she's gone it's so suspicious,
So delicious, nutritious, vicious, wishing that I could kiss this.
Now it's years since I've been in a crush, and now we've split.
Yet my tears are still drowning my face, can I recommit?
It's gonna take time to get over the cheat,
So I will lay myself down with my FATBOYS on repeat!

Fall back‘cause I'm running away from the attack
and I'm waiting to get on track

Till now I've been alone inside this crowd
Without talking to anyone
Suffering from this escape
Was it all planned from the start?
Was it all planned from the start?
因果と悲しみに深く枯れた孤独
最後の苦しみは生き果てた鼓動
Over and over again in this place
You turned your back before I turned away
Over and over again in this place
You turned yourback

Till now I was alone, feeling depressed
Without letting anyone know
Surviving by faking it
Will it be forgiven in time?
Will it be forgiven in time?
因果と投げ捨てた光と闇響く
際限なく際限なく切り裂いて笑う
Over and over again in this place
You turned your back before I turned away
Over and over again in this place
I saw your back, trembling in grief
I saw your back, trembling in grief
I saw a shadow dying behind

Cause and effect…

Once again, these promises I made
Being late again for the promises I made
Once again, these promises I made
Breaking again the promises I made
Once again, these promises I made
Once again, these promises I made
You turned your back before I turned away
I saw your back, trembling in grief
I saw a shadow dying behind
I saw your back, trembling in grief
I saw a shadow dying behind

My father told me
“Hey, you gotta listen to me.
You know I'm drunken all day.

Hey, is this my fault?
or because of someone else's?
I have no idea.

But my son,
If you don't mind me at all,
can you become for me 'No. 1' ?”

蟠るより結果出しちまえ
あの地平線目指し this world is mine
隙を見せてたら捕まっちまう
逃げ切るまで走れ two thousand miles

Pump! Pump! Pump!
Let's pump it up!×3
この一瞬で

My boss told me
“Hey, you ought to go anywhere,
once lightning strick you.

Life is very short
and there's no time to waste.
Guess who's behind you?

The line is getting longer
than you expected.
Right now, show me you're the 'No.1' ”

蟠るより結果出しちまえ
あの地平線目指し this world is mine
ウカウカしてたら くたばっちまう
振り返らず走れ two thousand miles

Pump! Pump! Pump!
Let's pump it up!×3
この一瞬で

Pump! Pump! Pump!...

蟠るより結果出しちまえ
あの地平線目指し this world is mine
隙を見せてたら捕まっちまう
逃げ切るまで走れ two thousand miles

Pump! Pump! Pump!
Let's pump it up!...

got my back on the
wall
There's nothing
in my way
I know it's gonna
be alright
Evil is what I am
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down

Sinful rhythm
in my mind
I'm on my way
back home
You make me wanna
pack my backs
But still your
waving your flags
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down

Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down
Every moment
I count down

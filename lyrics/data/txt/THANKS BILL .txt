Sometimes in our life
We all have sorrow
But we know there's always tomorrow
Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be a friend I'll help you move on

Looking on the sunny side of life
Looking on the funny side of life
Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be your friend I'll help you move on

You just call on me
When you need a hand
Ask me
When you feel down
Lean on me
If you need somebody
You just call on me
When you need a friend

Everyone needs somebody
When you feel there is nobody
Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be a friend I'll help you move on

You just call on me
When you need a hand
Follow me
When you feel sad
Lean on me
If you need somebody
You just call on me
When you need a friend

If you're looking for a brother
If you're looking for a friend
Who'll go with you to the end
You just call on me

I'm always your frien

You just call on me
When you need a hand
Ask me
When you feel bad
Follow me
When you feel sad
Lean on me
If you need somebody

You just call on me
When you need a hand
Ask me
When you feel down
Lean on me
If you need somebody
You just call on me
When you need a friend

You just call on me
I'm always your friend

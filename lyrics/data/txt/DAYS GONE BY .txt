Often in my memory I wander
The evergreen of days gone by
Like a book of poetry
Each page a story of my life

Trustin' in my visions of glory
I felt myself growing strong
Much too young yet to understand
Too proud to say I was wrong

Love was such a mystery
When it first came along
If I'd known what I know now
I would still be holding on

Time makes a fool of a memory
And yet my memories still shine
Though yesterday may never come again
I sing of days gone by

Funny how the images still liger
Though seasons faded into years
But once it seemed the world was mine
And mine the laughter and tears

Kept one eye upon a star
Searched my heart for the truth
Now I know I've come this far
Riding the dreams of my youth

Time makes a fool of a memory
And yet my memories still shine
Though yesterday may never come again
I sing of days gone by

I can't say the past was really better
But I was never more alive
If I could do it all again
I'd do it just the same
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change days gone by

Time makes a fool of a memory
And yet my memories still shine
Though yesterday may never come again
I sing of days gone by

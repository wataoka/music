Dark of the night
It hits like a blinding light
Wasn't it me could do without you ?
No look who's awake
Wonderin' if it's too late
Who was so sure she'd never miss you ?

Crazy me, Crazy for you
Here I am, it's
Crazy me, Crazy for
You are the one who gave me the love that I need
Crazy me

Remember the day
I thought I could walk away
Like I was the one with nothing to lose
Now look who's come around
Guess who woke up and found
She couldn't live living without you

Crazy me, Crazy for you
Here I am, it's
Crazy me, Crazy for
You are the one who gave me the love that I need
Crazy me

I look at the stars and I wonder
Are you still there?
There with the love that I never could see
Now, who would give anything to see you ?

Crazy me, crazy for you
Here I am it's
Crazy me, crazy for you
Crazy me
(Remember the night)
Crazy me, crazy for you
Here I am, it's
Crazy me, crazy for you
(Remember the night)
Crazy me, crazy for you
Here I am, it's
Crazy me, crazy for you
Crazy me

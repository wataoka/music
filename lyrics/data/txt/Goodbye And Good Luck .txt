It's likely to snow tonight
I gazed out of the window
“Goodbye and good luck my friend”

She said to me“Will you come?”
I didn't know whether to stay or go
I wish I could be there someday

Yes I think it's all right
She'll make out fine with no mistakes

Looking back on the good old days
We had a long talk about it
We were awake through the night oh yeah

I'll miss you very much if you move
I want to go there with you
my dream will come true someday

Yes I think it's all right
She'll make out fine with no mistakes

I wonder whether it will be fine
Will be fine tomorrow
In the cold winter night I say

Goodbye and good luck to you yeah
I wish to go there
oh see you again

I thought of the happy days
When I was in our dream
Yeah see you again
the snow whispers down wo yeah

Fall went quickly and X'mas
Came to soon it's time you went
I wish you good luck my friend

Looking back on the good old days
I cried till my eyes dried
I'm going to miss you

Yes I think it's all right
She'll make out fine with no mistakes

I wonder whether it will be fine
Will be fine tomorrow
In the cold winter night I say

I thought of the happy days
When I was in our dream
Yeah see you again
the snow whispers down wo yeah

Say“Goodbye and good luck”
I'm with you all the way
Oh see you again

I thought of the happy days
When I was in our dream
Yeah see you again
the snow whispers down wo yeah

“Goodbye and good luck”wo yeah

Sometimes I feel so all alone
Finding myself callin' your name

When we're apart, so far away
Hopin' it's me that you're thinkin' of

Could it be true, could it be real
My heart says that you're the one

there's no one else you're the only one for me
Yes, this time my love's the real thing

Never felt that love is so right
The world seemed such an empty place
We need someone we could give our all
Baby, it's you, we'll be together now and forever

Could it be true, could it be real
My heart says that you're the one

there's no one else you're the only one for me
Yes, this time my love's the real thing

Never felt that love is so right
The world seemed such an empty place
We need someone we could give our all
Baby, it's you, we'll be together now and forever

Never felt that love is so right
The world seemed such an empty place
We need someone we could give our all
Baby, it's you, we'll be together now and forever

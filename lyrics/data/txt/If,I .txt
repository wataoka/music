If you saw my face
would you wald away?
all the things you've said,
and the moves you've made
I guess it wasn't just for me

put your lips to mine
one kiss will make me fine
I gave my time, space, love
gave you all I had
but it didn't mean a thing at all

Everytime I just keep on
looking for the answer
why I still go crazy for you
Everynight I pray just to
have you back in my arms
'cause I'm crying dying can't you see?

If I see you now
あの日のようにBabyそう呼ばせて
あたしだけ求めて
come and kiss me now
数える痛みBaby 名前つけて
ふたりのものにしたい
I have to see you now

If I saw your face
you'll take my breath away
all the things you've said
and the moves you've made
I still remember, can't let go

I wanna be your girl
I would dream of you, crave you
Oh yes each and every day

I need you right now
I would clean up your mess,
so color me in pink and have it your way

If I see you now
最後の願いBabyあの日のまま
あたしだけ描いて
come and kiss me now
偽り・涙Baby裸にして
ふたりで見つめてたい
I have to see you now

Everytime I just keep on
looking for the answer
why I still go crazy for you
Everynight I pray just to
have you back in my arms
'cause I'm crying dying can't you see?

If I see you now
あの日のようにBabyそう呼ばせて
あたしだけ求めて
come and kiss me now
数える痛みBaby 名前つけて
ふたりのものにしたい
I have to see you now

If I see you now
最後の願いBabyあの日のまま
あたしだけ描いて
come and kiss me now
偽り・涙Baby裸にして
ふたりで見つめてたい
I have to see you now

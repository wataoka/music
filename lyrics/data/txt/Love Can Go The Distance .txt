I CAN FLY,TO THE STARS,IN THE SKY
ALL I REALLY NEED IS YOUR HAND IN MINE
SATISFIED, JUST TO BE,BY YOUR SIDE THAT'S THE WAY
I'D LIKE TO SPEND ALL MY TIME
BUT LIFE IS FULL OF DREAMS
THAT DON'T COME TRUE RIGHT NOW
IT'S KEEPING ME APART FROM YOU
I'M LOST WITHOUT YOU,I NEED HELP
TO PULL ME THROUGH LOVE CAN GO THE DISTANCE

OH DARING, WHEN WE'RE NOT TOGHETHER (I'M) MISSING YOU
SO MUCH, LONGING FOR YOUR TOUCH WAITING BY THE PHONE TONIGHT
LOVE CAN GO THE DISTANCE
OH DARING WE CAN KEEP THE FEELING
WHEN YOU TELL ME YOU, LOVE ME TOO
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT PHOTOGRAPH,
YOU & ME, MAKES ME LAUGH GAZING AT YOUR FACE & I FEEL THE GLOW
ECHOES OF,SUMMER NIGHTS,MAKING LOVE
TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP BUT MY HEART SAYS NO
DON'T THINK THAT I CAN LAST ANOTHER DAY I HAVE TO CALL YOU
WHEN I FEEL THIS WAY IT'S LIKE I'M NEAR YOU,
IT COMFORTS ME TO HEAR YOU SAY LOVE CAN GO THE DISTANCE
OH DARRING, WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY,
TIME IS ON OUR SIDE SOON I'M GONNA
HOLD YOU TIGHT LOVE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE
YOU KNOW THAT LOVE LIGHTS UP THE DARKNESS
DARLING, YOU WILL BE, NEXT TO ME AND EVERYTHING
WILL BE ALRIGHT LOVE CAN GO THE DISTANCE

OH DARLING, WHEN WE'RE NOT TOGETHER (I'M) MISSING YOU
SO MUCH, LONGING FOR YOUR TOUCH WATING BY THE PHONE TONIGHT
LOVE CAN GO THE DISTANCE
OH DARING WE CAN KEEP THE FEELING
WHEN YOU TELL ME YOU, LOVE ME TOO
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT
WHEN YOU TELL ME YOU, LOVE ME TOO
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT WHEN YOU TELL ME YOU, LOVE ME TOO
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT
BE ALRIGHT BE ALRIGHT

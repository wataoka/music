Ey ey ey eya
I'm hearing voices in the derelict silence
Like ghosts from a vast beyond howling out in song
Now turn my motor on
It's like no other place I know Now drive the snow

It's getting colder
It's getting colder
It's getting colder
It's getting colder
And the reindeer cry
How long must we suffer 'til we die
And the elders sing
How long 'til the ice will cover everything
It's getting colder Colder

The droning wind beats a rolling drum
Take shelter and wait for the winter to come
Right underneath the frost
I can hear the breathing of insect life
Like they're coming up for air
In a morning prayer for a world getting older
and an end drawing near

Colder
It's getting colder
It's getting colder
It's getting colder
And the sled dogs whine
How long must we suffer 'til the sunshine
And the keepers sing
How long 'til the ice will melt into spring
It's calling me from a world I cannot see
Inviting me to a place where spirits wander aimlessly

forget about me forsaken hero
forget about me the battle has just begun
over the theory army build words around me
all this time is wasted

try to move on move on
take a step to the red sky but I don't know why
better go on go on
get a grip to the end of days I will survive

迷走する激情制限した未来絵図切り取れず
羨望を投げかける原動力を抑え込む幻想

かざした旗の元で沈む悲しみに目を向けずに
突き刺した今を美しいと言う真実を見ていた

get a grip to the end of days I will survive

かざした旗の元で沈む悲しみに目を向けずに
突き刺した今を美しいと言う真実を見ていた

somebody comes around surrounded by a threat
It's all crap lost in the trip
live or dead another frequency confuses my deadly rule

follow you trying to get back the light from future
follow you breaking the fall from past itself

翻る旗を手に掴んだ理想と見上げる影
悲しみの丘は穏やかな風を求めていた
今を知って

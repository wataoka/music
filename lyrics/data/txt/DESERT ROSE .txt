Concrete surrounding...
With a single breath
They are freezing my heat
From the scar, I'm suffering
'Cause I'm leaving you, being punished for my sin

No one lives forever (forever more)
I can't stay anymore

I'm a criminal
Falling out of love
Just wanted to know
If you really need me

I'm a criminal
Without a doubt
You've got to show
If you really need me
You're my desert rose...

No lights are coming in...
But it's not the light
Nor the wind I'm missing
Wanna hold you in my arms
But I'm leaving you, put out of my misery

No one cries forever (forever more)
You can't stay anymore (hear my calling)

I'm a criminal
Falling out of love
I wonder how
We ended up like this

I'm a criminal
Always on the run
I know I was wrong
Let me love you again
You're my desert rose...

I'm a criminal
Falling out of love
Just wanted to know
If you really need me

I'm a criminal
Without a doubt
You've got to show
If you really need me

I'm a criminal
Falling out of love
I wonder how
We ended up like this

I'm a criminal
Always on the run
I know I was wrong
Let me love you again
You're my desert rose...

I'm a criminal

I'm a criminal
Falling out of love
Just wanted to know
If you really need me
You're my desert rose...

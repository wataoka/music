Everybody say hello to me
何も見えちゃない
かくれんぼ仕掛けたらやっと気付いた
Everybody say hello to me
柔い誰かさん
お空まで連れ去って
Blue, blue, sky blue

I'm just trying, you're just crying
どこに心なくしたの?
I don't know what to say, you don't know where to go
わたしにだけ教えて

Cause I wanted

You touch me 夜が来る前に
You kiss me
One time, two times, more than three times
You kiss me

Everybody say you're a lier
だけど信じない
あなたから聞けるまで
Turn black to white, you, you and you and me

I'm just trying, you're just crying
どこに言葉落としたの?
I don't know what to say, you don't know where to go
わたしにだけ教えて

Cause I wanted

You touch me 夜が来る前に
You kiss me
One time, two times, more than three times
You kiss me

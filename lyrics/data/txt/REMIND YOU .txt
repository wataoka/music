Who passed away each one in the fight
There was no doubt we started for pride
And your grief stays too long
then the war brings it worst
Tell me why? we're stuck in this deep black hole

Count it from me
No one knows our day'll be
Don't be afraid everyone will reach for last
Nothing but without you I can not go on
Now I'm touching to the core of the light
Sharing with you for a while tiny moment
All I can give you for some help
Just reminds you

Who passed away each one for the fight
There was no doubt we dreamt of the ride
And your grief stays too long
then the war brings it worst
Now we searching for under the hope with you

Count it from me
My heart beat get slower
Don't be surprise everyone will die at last
Nothing but without you I can not go on
Now I'm looking for the place to belong

Into my brain
from top to the bottom all over my skin
All of me is lashed with high fever
Don't say just yes, Oh no matter what they have made up
All the things must fix them by yourself

Past to the present
Slave to the power
But is our
Bravely from desire
Quest for the future

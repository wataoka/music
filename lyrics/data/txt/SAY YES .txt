Every time
君に見つめられる度
Girl, you so fine
押さえられない
Feelings 溢れ go crazy, go crazy...

愛想ないのに構わない
I'm losing control,
Losing, losing control
Oh baby, eyesとeyes 合わすそれが合図
Baby let's get it down

Tonight, I wanna hear you “SAY YES”
隣で just be my lady
君だけさ want you “SAY YES”
You know I got to know, got to know tonight

I wanna hear you “SAY YES”
そばにいて be my baby
離さない just come and “SAY YES”
I wanna make you mine, make you mine tonight

Every mile
君の為に超える度
Girl, you so nice
忘れられない
その魅力 So amazing, amazing...

愛想ないはずなのにdive!
I'm losing control,
Losing, losing control
Baby, 愛と愛 2人だけの合図
Baby I want it now...

Tonight, I wanna hear you “SAY YES”
他にいない you got me crazy
君なのさ want you “SAY YES”
You know we got to go, got to go tonight

I wanna hear you “SAY YES”
ここにきて be my baby
抱きしめる so, won't you “SAY YES”
I want you to stay with me, stay with me tonight

もしも君が feel
So 1人で, 寂しいなら baby...
この僕が show you
What the real love...
What the real love is baby...

Tonight, I wanna hear you “SAY YES”
隣で just be my lady
君だけさ want you “SAY YES”
You know I got to know, got to know tonight

I wanna hear you “SAY YES”
離さない just come and “SAY YES”
I wanna make you mine, make you mine tonight

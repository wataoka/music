If I shed black tears, you might hate me.
It can't help your values are so different from me.
Tried to understand so hard what you are tellin' me
But I think your ideal is stupid.

Let me in my part different from the other people, you know?

But I still do cry in that way.
You see, I can't believe in anything anymore
Don't you say“you'll be alright”, why do you say such a sinful thing
I could choose the another life.

歪んでく心の中で 重力のせいだとニュートンは言った
一般相対性理論でだって左右できない
時の流れには歯向かう事はできない

浮き世の世界なら実現して描けるのだろうか

時は過去でも未来でも 同じ速度で刻んでゆく
その度愛が生まれ また消えてゆく 受け継がれてる

But I still do cry in that way.
You see, I can't believe in anything anymore
Don't you say you'll be alright, why do you say such a sinful thing
I could choose the another life.

時は過去でも未来でも 同じ速度で刻んでゆく
その度愛が生まれ また消えてゆく 受け継がれてる
The black world.

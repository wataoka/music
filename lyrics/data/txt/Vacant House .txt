I died last year.
Because my soul cracked deeply.
So this brain has also
begun to be insane.

But I was sometimes calm.
I worried about inheritance
and wrote a will many times.
That was funny work.

I talk nonsense now.
「The life is unfair」
When thinking, I'm blessed.
Though I'm a man
who lacks only affection.
So everyone is leaving.

I died last year.
That dog and that cat.
Good-bye, give my best
regards to the owner.

I talk nonsense now.
「The life is unfair」
When thinking, I'm blessed.
I rose to wealth.
But I feel nothing.
I'm a tedious man.

I died last year.
Because my soul cracked deeply.
So this brain has also
begun to be insane.

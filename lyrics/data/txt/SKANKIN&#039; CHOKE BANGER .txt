There's just not enough time! Give it all that you've got!
You only get that one shot! Can't live with shame in your life!
Oh yeah! (Oh yeah!) All right! (All right!) Give it all that you've got!
You only get that one shot! Can't live with shame in your life!

Don't wanna live in misery. Do what you're gonna do. Yes, yes, start today.
Everybody moving, moving, doing, doing. Yes, yes, start today.
Hey! Change yourself from inside.
Pull up a vice. Remove. Pull up a vibes with you. Everybody move.
 
少しのためらいもそこに残したままで 人並みの優しさや冷たさを
解った様な顔で嘘も願いも 叫び続けたんだ

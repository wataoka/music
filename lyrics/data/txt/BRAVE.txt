we must jump over some dimensions
we want an answer for a riddle of the death
I know that you have a lot of emotions
we want an answer for a riddle in the life

the moment of their lives sparkle intensely
fight, with your brave and lofty mind

the sky is so cool, so high, so beautiful
don't be afraid, pray for the all living thing

we must fly across from the limitation
we want an answer for a secret of the past

devote yourself to feel the reflection
we want an answer for a secret in the future

the moment of their lives sparkle quietly
fight, with your brave and lofty mind

the sky is so calm, so near, so glorious
don't be afraid, pray for the all little thing

we must run through the evaporation
push your way, even if the road is so hard
believe in your soul, hope, and determination
push your way, even if the road is so dark

the moment of their lives sparkle strangely
fight, with your brave and lofty mind

the sky is so warm, so clear, so tender
don't be afraid, pray for the all living thing

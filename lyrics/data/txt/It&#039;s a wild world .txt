Five years ago
I was in the maze
And been a rude, been a damn
Looking for a thing what I can bite
I was like a wild street cat
But I,
I had a dream
And I'm still searching for

It seems like
Long time ago
No fear for fight
No scare to lose
It's been a while
Since power's gone
(what) I used to have
(how) I used to be...

Hey Boy! Look at yourself
Is that the one you want to be?
Hey Girl! Enjoy your life
Don't look back, and take your chance
Hey Boy! Take up your arms
Break the wall, Reach for the top
Hey Girl! Open your eyes
Even if you're in end of the world

Say Woo
Say Woo

I found it out
What I've done
No excuse, No place to hide
It's on my own
It's on your own
We can take the chance we got

Hey Boy! Look at yourself
Is that the one you want to be?
Hey Girl! Enjoy your life
Don't look back, and take your chance
Hey Boy! Take up your arms
Break the wall, Reach for the top
Hey Girl! Open your eyes
Even if you're in end of the world

Hey Boy! Look at yourself
Is that the one you want to be?
Hey Girl! Open your eyes
Even if you're in end of the world

Say Woo

I can see you wonder, just always you do.
I know you get under your aching sad fire.
"Everybody's in vain", you're whispering yourself.
You're in trap again that's, no, you don't wanna be.

Follow your own heart even though naive.
Get ready to start. I truly believe,
Taking modesty never ever helps you,
Having honesty leads to the way to go.

Don't be afraid of failing in the game.
You don't want to care for the name.
Don't worry being alone in the dark,
For any where, for any time,
You will find me by you.

Remember technicolor dream once we had,
As we keep it deeply yet still alive,
So we hold it tightly yet still in time.
We can make it come true with our soul.
Let's head up toward the Sun in sky.
It's long overdue to spread wings to fly.
We are brave it out with our own pride,
Give a reason, for life over again.

You are impassive to mate with yesterday.
I am aggressive to wait for tomorrow.
Why don't you take off your backward desire?
That's wrapping you like a heavy coat to tire.

We are the team go on together,
Having respect for each other.
As far as you stick to your own pride,
For any where,for any time,
You will find me by you.

Remember technicolor dream once we had,
As we keep it deeply yet still alive,
So we hokd it tightly yet still in time.
We can make it come true with our soul.
Let's head up toward the Sun in the sky.
It's long overdue to spread wings to fly.
We are brave it out with our own pride,
Catch a season to prove in our style.

Feeling so tired, can't understand it
Just had a fortnight's sleep
I'm feeling so shot,
Ow! so distracted, ain't touched a thing all week

I'm feeling drunk, juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night,
I'm feeling hungry, can't see the reason,
just had a horse meat pie.

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog.
Yeah when you lay me out,
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum.

Yeah you got to mix it child,
ya got to fix it must be love.
It's a bitch,
you got to mix it child,
ya got to fix it must be love.
It's a bitch, alright.

Sometimes I'm sexy, move like a stud
Kicking the stall all night.
Sometimes I'm so shy.
Got to be worked on, don't have no bark or bite.

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog.
Yeah when you lay me out,
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum.

I've had a question
OK? I wanna tell you
(hey! you!)listen to me babe
tell me what you think about me
I wanna hear you
(hey! you!)I can't put up with you no…
you said that you wanted it
why should I buy you it?
(why? you!)
listen to me babe
tell me what you think about me
I wanna hear you
(why? you!)
I can't put up with you no…

every time I call you in the night , you were a little strange
why? who's there? what are you doing?
I know a girl who has beautiful eyes
don't you misunderstand oneself?
you aren't so cool , you aren't rich
you say to girls “sexy or cool?” I can't believe it

everyday every night I need you
everyday every night I miss you
everyday every night I hate you paya duludu
everyday every night I need you
everyday every night I miss you
everyday every night I hate you but I love you

I'll say good-bye
OK? I'll find another guy
(hey! you!) listen to me babe
tell me what you think about me
I wanna hear you
(hey! you!) I can' put up with you no…

Night's begun and the silence stretches in town
Dreams invade into rationalizers' veins
Sick smelling beauty creeps out of bitches' blood

Darkness deepens the moonlit empty square
Follow me or you'll never get your pleasure
Open up the door and run to the place

To dance on the stone pavements
To dance with crowded flock

We'll be dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around to the end of night
We'll be dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around in the crimson town, tonight

From dusk 'til dawn, we will be alive
Here I come, celebrate your sins

To dance on the stone pavements
To dance with crowded flock

We'll be dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around to the end of night
We'll be dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around
Dancing around in the crimson town, tonight

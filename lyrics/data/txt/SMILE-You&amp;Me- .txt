Here's my heart,no need to worry
The stars above,shine bright in the night
Just call my name if you're feeling blue
Cheer up,I'll be with you
Here's your heart,I'm not feeling lonely
We can make it,hope our dreams will all come true
Go on, smile for you and me

Just a little more time
Let's stay together, my friend
Won't you tell me why
Let me know what makes you cry

One day in your life
Don't you know things can change, my friend
Won't you dry your eyes
Someday you will find your light

Shining,jumping,singing, dreaming,growing...
So just the way you are

Here's my heart,no need to hurry
'Cause no one can take away your right
In every case,you can break through
Realize,I think of you
Here's your heart,happy-go-lucky
We can make it,hope our dreams will all come true
Go on,smile for you and me

Even if you lose your way
Remember,live for today
Set your spirit free
That's the only way to be
Believe in yourself

Here's my heart,no need to worry
The stars above,shine bright in the night
Just call my name if you're feeling blue
Cheer up,I'll be with you
Here's your heart,I'm not feeling lonely
We can make it,hope our dreams will all come true
Go on, smile for you and me

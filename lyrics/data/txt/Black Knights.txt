No horizons
No horizons
Our Darkest dreams will lead us onward
Let us forge ahead
Making clear the way
O Black Knights!
Swear the oath right here
Onward!

No horizons
World encompassed
Our Darkest dreams will lead us onward
Souls this young and free
Know no limits
Now is the time
Come!
Grab life while we can
It's time
Onward!

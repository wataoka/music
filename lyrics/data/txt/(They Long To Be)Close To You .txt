Why do birds
Suddenly appear?
Everytime you are near
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

Why do stars
Fall down from the sky?
Everytime
You walk by
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together and decided
To create a dream come true
So they spinkled moondust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why
All the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together and decided
To create a dream come true
So they spinkled moondust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why
All the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

Just like me
They long to be
Close to you

Wow! Close to you
Wow! Close to you
Wow! Close to you
Wow! Close to you

I look up the sky
And I just wonder
How you are doing
And how is your new life

Time runs so fast
The snow falls on my cheek
Reminds me of the day you left
I saw you vanished in the snow

It's funny I still see your smile with my eyes closed
I try not to say but I miss you
It's funny I still have your coffee cup on my table
I try not to say but I still miss you

Maybe I was wrong
I shouldn't pretend that
I was strong enough to live without you

I look up the sky
And I just Dream
Dream of better days
And no more lonely nights

It's funny I still see your smile with my eyes closed
I try not to say but miss you
It's funny I still have your coffee cup on my table
I try not to say but I still miss you

It seems like out of nowhere
I'm standing alone and
I can't stop thinking about you

Thinking about you
Thinking about you

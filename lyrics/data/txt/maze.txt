if you seek for the fire in your eyes
if you wanna be a liar you're the one
wanna be a silly one find the fire in your eyes

come and look for a mystical maze
if you want me be a lier I'm the one
want me be a silly one I'll be there in your eyes

we two dive in the mystical maze
unsolvable riddles waiting
love me now, or leave me in the dark
if you need me there's no need to cry for me
I'm in your eyes

joy will come when the summer is lost
if you're searchin for a good one I'm the one
gonna show you bad one I will take you right away

wake and feel for the fell of dark
what a helpless rejyoicing what a pain
gonna search for sweet things I will take you far away

can't you see the love that I gave you
don't you see the love that you found
you should know the love that you want is
ever in your heart
if you seek the fire in your eyes and
if you want the fire in your heart

if you seek for the fire in your eyes
if you wanna be a liar you're the one
wanna be a silly one find the fire in your eyes

come and look for the mystical maze
if you want me be a liar I'm the one
want me be a silly one 
I'll be there in your eyes
I'll be there in your eyes

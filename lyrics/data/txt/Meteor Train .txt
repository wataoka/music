oh if you don't wanna talk about it now
what are you doing just standing there?
don't fool away your precious time
never change a bit

もし今君がここで少しでも前向けるなら
取り戻せばいいさ never come back again

I created my blog in
after its not my day
like scribble in the diary

already filled,
so everyting and anything
夢の続きを everlasting we will chase
wish on the meteor train,
"so what do you mean?"
or "what do you think?"
we'll recapture the thread of
our some mathched up dream

already filled my heat,
the breathing and fixed time
when I had the chance broken
cause laughter on your face
fading away from me again

outer meteor speed, has mercy
走り書きのheart 聴いてないで泣いて湧いた reserve army
hey 立ち止まる前に look skyward, don7t you worry
hey かしこまる前に need to consult with you about one thing

I created my blog in
after its not my day
like scribble in the diary

今が続けばいいさと
夢見心地でいたんだ
僕らは

already filled,
so everyting and anything
夢の続きを everlasting we will chase
wish on the meteor train,
"so what do you mean?"
or "what do you think?"
we'll recapture the thread of
our some mathched up dream

already filled my heat,
the breathing and fixed time
when I had the chance broken
cause laughter on your face
fading away from me again

絶好の機会も because I just couldn't
that laughter on my face
gave the game away 時間を無駄にしてた
already filled my heart,

so everyting and anything
夢の続きを everlasting we will chase
wish on the meteor train,
"so what do you mean?"
or "what do you think?"
we'll recapture the thread of
our some mathched up dream

already filled my heart,
裸足で駆けてたあの頃が
fading away from me again

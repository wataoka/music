No sound No wind No shadow
You look so sad and you look so blue
I couldn'ft resist walking away
Walking on the empty street
Listening to the empty tape
Nothing else is over me
Nothing else is over me
No sound no wind no shadow
How many birds did I see since you left me here? 
The sun is glaring at me just staring at me with his fake sunshine
Why so many people leave off so easily.
Why so many people talk so much about their dreams.
Stay where you were and you hear what you hear
Don't close your eyes coz you miss something.

Oh Take a look in the mirror you look so sad
It's so cold like that winter market we used to go
I don't cry anymore but I feel so hurt

So I don't need you to close to me
You don't hear me so you said
I don't know why thing have changed since
yesterday

This could be love again
All I need is you
Comeback, I'm waiting, Anytime
The heavy rains come
Still I miss days with you
I can't look into your face
Oh Feeling blue and looking back again
Please come back to me

Oh Take a look in the mirror you look so sad
It's so cold like that winter market we used to go
I don't cry anymore but I feel so hurt

So I don't need you to close to me
You don't hear me so you said
I don't know why thing have changed since
yesterday

This could be love again
All I need is you
Comeback, I'm waiting, Anytime
The heavy rains come
Still I miss days with you
I can't look into your face
Oh Feeling blue and looking back again
Please come back to me

To stay with you always
You're the world to me, and dream on
Take my sword again for you
How do you feel, so fine
You're the world to me, and dream on
You stole my heart so long ago
Oh I release my soul
So you feel my song

I can be myself whenever you're around
'Cause I know that you'll be near when I look around
Make me feel that everything is going to be fine
I know that you would take away the fear I have
And you show me the way, like the god would do
Now I know that I am not by myself any more
Forever love

I was all alone
I was lost, didn't know what to do
'till you came into my life
With the true love, I never ever had
It was like sun light, shinning down on me

I can be myself whenever you're around
'Cause I know that you'll be near when I look around
Make me feel that everything is going to be fine
I know that you would take away the fear I have
And you show me the way, like the god would do
Now I know that I am not by myself any more
Forever love, forever love

Baby, you're the one
That's what you said when I was down
Then you kissed me tenderly
With the true heart, I never ever had
It was like moon light, shining down on me

I can be myself whenever you're around
'Cause I know that you'll be near when I look around
Make me feel that everything is going to be fine
I know that you would take away the fear I have
And you show me the way, like the god would do
Now I know that I am not by myself any more
Forever love, forever love

Forever love, we will be so much in love, eternally
Foss and fight, we might have some,
We'll be together forever

I can be myself whenever you're around
'Cause I know that you'll be near when I look around
Make me feel that everything is going to be fine
I know that you would take away the fear I have
And you show me the way, like the god would do
Now I know that I am not by myself any more
Forever love

I can be myself whenever you're around
'Cause I know that you'll be near when I look around
Make me feel that everything is going to be fine
I know that you would take away the fear I have
And you show me the way, like the god would do
Now I know that I am not by myself any more
Forever love, forever love

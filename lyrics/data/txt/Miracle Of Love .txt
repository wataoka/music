Inside a dream
For a fleeting moment you appeared
And you whispered that it won't be long
That our time was near…
In search of you
From a distant place in time I've come
Driven by the need to love
For the higher angels have planned long ago
That the mystery of life will unfold
Only when we learn the lessons of love
And we find the truth that lies deep within

So we journey on into the void again
Till we meet our final destiny
For the miracle was written in the stars
That one day we shall return
United once again

Along the way
We should nearly walk so close and yet…
With a twist of fate we turn
And so live on with
Lonely eyes that never will meet
And groping hands that never will clasp
Calling out in vain to no one who hears
Till we die alone,our dreams unfulfilled

And we journey on into the void again
Till we meet our final destiny
For the miracle was written in the stars
That one day we shall return
Once again

And we journey on into the void again
Till we meet our final destiny
For the miracle was written in the stars
That one day we shall return
Once again

To the Golden Land
Where we first began

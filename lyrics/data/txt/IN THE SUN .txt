When a tender touch becomes a lullaby
And the melody consumes you like a song
Then you can see true love begin to live

We can watch love's hands of time grow and grow
Standing ready for each challenge as we go
Our eyes have seen beyond any question

In the sun
Feel the warmth blessing everyone
Could it be that's what we've become
A beam of life love's inspiration

Through the happy tears that cloud our eyes
We can see so clearly love's surprise
Float me away oh so high

Now we count the meaning of our fate
Cause to hold each other close we just can't wait
The truth defines the light that blinds

In the sun
Celebrate the joy that we've become
Into a journey's no time
Where only true love can climb

In the sun
Higher than most have ever dreamed
Only heart's eyes have seen
Where heaven truly begins a beam

In the sun darling
Love's keeps shining
No light so bright
Love keeps me love leads me
In the sun

In the sun
Feel the warmth blessing everyone
Could it be that's what we've become
A beam of life love's inspiration

In the sun
Celebrate the joy that we've become
Into a journey's no time
Where only true love can climb

In the sun
Lalala...

The singing sea
The talking trees
A Silent in a noisy way

The stars are blight
But give no light
The world spins backward everyday

A rainbow rat
A checkered cat
Go fail in tail around the road
The mouse is pleased
The moon is cheese
The sun is shining hot and cold

A golden bird
Today I heard
Sitting upon a silver branch
His little song was very long
Which made me sad and start to laugh

My sister is he
My brother is she
But there is only me in the family
When I grow up
I'll go down
The river to the Singing Sea

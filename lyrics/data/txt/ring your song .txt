now we've come so far from darkness
and will never be apart
so we leave for tomorrow
to start our lives again

find me there, my tiny feathers
of my holy ancient days
you will calm all my sadness
and ring your song
only for me

find me there, my tiny feathers
of my holy ancient days
I will calm all your sadness
and sing my song
only for you

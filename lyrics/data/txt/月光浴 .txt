波、波、涙を隠す
波間にしゃがみ、泣いている
Moon and 夕、blend to 奏でる
砂、風、月の下僕踊る

Sound of waves repeating themselves
found the names that made some sense
Counting the 日々that passed 夕日に翳す shadow は何処に
Under the 月光 wonder to see her
dancing to the ocean whisper
Mama I need you here Papa she needs you there
愛を Give to you 愛してあげる
Image it image it, You got the image

人、人、一つの愛は
行き先無くし、泣いている
Moon and 夕、blend to 奏でる
砂、風、月の下僕踊る

It started like this
Two boys, they made a list of the things that they missed
From the ocean and on the sand.
built a building where everybody sang
Gradually more people gathered
and the song grew larger and larger
Enjoyed music breeze from the sea
This view they dreamed to see

But situations changed
Everybody faded away
They walked walked away
Realized what they missed from the list
The word「thank you very much」
Now it starts allover from scratch

波、波、涙を隠す
波間にしゃがみ、泣いている
Moon and 夕、blend to 奏でる
砂、風、月の下僕踊る

人、人、一人の君は
地平線見つめ、歩いていく

It's sad to say but you can't save anyone
And no one can save you anyway
The eternity that you hoped, has changed to regret
And only despair remains

Stop crying!
Stop crying!
Stop crying, no more
Because crying makes you sad without real sadness

It's sad to say but your goal is full of hardships
You will be surrounded by dried up hatred
Craven sympathy becomes a betrayal
And you'll be looked down on in disdain

Stop evading!
Stop evading!
Stop evading, no more
Because evading makes you suffer an unfeeling heart

Doubt your soul!

Stop crying!
Stop crying!
Stop crying, no more
Because crying makes you sad without real sadness

It's sad to say but you can't save anyone
And no one can save you anyway
The eternity that you hoped, has changed to regret
And only despair remains

Doubt your soul!

Doubt my soul!

DOUBLE-BLIND DOCUMENTS

残念な事に
貴方は誰のことをも救えず
また何物も貴方を救わない
残念な事に
望んだ永遠は無念となり
胸を突かれる失意が残る

泣くな
泣くな
もう泣くな
泣けば涙に悲しみを覚える

残念な事に
貴方の行く先は険しさで溢れ
また乾いた憎しみに囲まれる
残念な事に
臆病な同調は裏切りとなり
蔑む眼差しに曝される

避けるな
避けるな
もう避けるな
避ければ心の貧しい困難を生む

疑え
疑え
己を疑え

疑え
疑え
私を疑え

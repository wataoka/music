This is all about you yeah
Flowers of your love
I want you to tell me...

So crazy about you
Like totally breathless
It was my...first love
I threw away everything for you
And I thought you could do that too
I lost myself in your eyes and couldn't help
How silly I was
And when you left me all alone
Why couldn't I tell you “Please, don't go away”?

But I said, “It's over”
'Cause I believed in you
I was bluffing...
Now I know
I could do better for you
Too late, to wait
I cry without the voice
I know I was wrong
I try to wash the pain away from me

※So tell me, tell me
Was our love for real?
It's sad to say it had to be done
Really, really
Sweetest memories
You made me feel like I am worthy
Baby, baby
I gotta get over
Your smile's branded on my mind
I need to tell you something you don't know
“I'm sorry”
I hope everything we did was right
I thank you for your love
The flowers of your love※

Blooming
The flowers
That you gave me
It's still in my heart
So beautiful
When I was alone
You came around
And say “it's okay”
Then take me to another place
I liked everything
The way you make me feel
You helped me believe
You set me free
The only thing I needed was you babe
I just wanted you by my side

But now it's over since
I fell in love with you
I had this feeling
Something special
Oh something real
I say goodbye
Now I feel you so far away
Oh please tell me
Why... You left me alone

(※くり返し)

I woke up in the dark
I was looking for you
But you were not with me
So lonely inside
I closed my eyes to see your face
I tried to remember
The dream of you
But I could just remember that you were smiling at me
Listen to that song you loved again and again
And your voice that I never hear anymore

So tell me, tell me
Was our love for real?
It's sad to say it had to be done
Really, really
Sweetest memories
You made me feel like I am worthy
So tell me, tell me
I gotta get over
Your smile's branded on my mind
Really, really
Sweetest memories
You made me feel like I  am worthy
Baby, baby
I loved you for real
And the time we were together
So sweet kisses
Your hand that touched me
The eyes that see me
And your sweet smell of your hair
Dalala...
And I'll never forget our days together
I thank you for your love
The flowers of your love

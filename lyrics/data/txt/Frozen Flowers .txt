They walk across the frozen lake
and lead me into the northern light
You look as the parade goes by
Don't be scared of the ghosts in you

They step into the darkest night
and call me by my forgotten name
You look at the dead flowers falling
Don't be scared of dying in your sleep

Can't you see anything clear
Can't you feel anything real

The scenery reflected in your eyes
The shapes changed in my mind
The memories are always there
Everything reminds me of you

Can't you see anything clear
Can't you feel anything real

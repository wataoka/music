There must be the scene I used to look
Have you seen it already?
In that scene I am standing really far
Draw the map with repetition failure
Burnish my refined sense
And if all roads in this world reaches to a sharpen cliff
Do not be afraid
The map to the future is drawn yourself.

Shouldn't look for short cuts
You can find your own way naturally
Or maybe you've known
Things you've passed aren't everything
The direction you should go
There is no searchlight
You can find groping your best way
No one can figure out if it is right
We are all crossing endless passage

I don't want to talk about conduct life
I don't think I am the answer
All are decided to your circumstances
Much luck across by coincidence
Unhappiness sparks happens many times
All reflects in your mirror
Choose one from many selections
With drawing your endless traveling map

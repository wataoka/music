I say hi now, c'mon baby
Long time no listen to my music
今君に伝うmelody line
愛の唄がmy job

Come on, yes, I'm playing my guitar
Sitting on a leather couch

Alright 好きさ c'mon baby
Wanna please you 惜しみ無くforever you
夢じゃありえないlife 今伝えたいlove
愛で行くのさ1.2.3

Come on, yes, I'm playing my guitar
Sitting on a leather couch
Isn't it easy to be myself now?
吹けよ愛のblues

I know I can make you feel so good
Rock you, rock me, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know I feel good enough This way
Rock you, rock me, oh, oh, oh, oh
愛の唄がmy job

Hey君に唄おうhello baby
I'm with you君と行こうit's alright
Don't stop the music
Give way to music
愛の唄がmy job
愛で行くのさ1.2.3

C'mon, yes, I'm playing my guitar
Sitting on a leather couch
Isn't it easy to be myself now?
行けよ愛のview

I know I can make you feel so good
Rock you, rock me, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know I feel good enough This way
Rock you, rock me, oh, oh, oh, oh

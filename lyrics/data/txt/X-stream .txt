Don't give it up!! Give it up!!
This is your way
Climbing up walls
"Gas pedal" to the floor
Mountain screams and calls your name

So get it up!! Get it up!!
You go ahead
Spitting out words and fist to the air
Ocean waits for your challenge
Make yourself run faster
Go to the new world

Our town sleeps in the midnight
Get ready to run away from the darkness
Don't ever wait for the daybreak
Before the morning comes, now get out here

Hey! Hey!
You're gonna rush around
I'm gonna watch you
Let's start it out
Hey! Hey!
Don't be afraid of getting out of control

Don't give it up!! Give it up!!
This is your way
Climbing up walls
"Gas pedal" to the floor
Mountain screams and calls your name

So get it up!! Get it up!!
You go ahead
Spitting out words and fist to the air
Ocean waits for your challenge
Make yourself run faster
Go to the new world

Now we drive to the sunrise
There's nothing we can't do when the night ends
All we see is a wild world
Feeling best ever, we're almost there

Hey! Hey!
You're gonna rush around
I'm gonna watch you
Let's start it out
Hey! Hey!
Don't be afraid of getting out of control

Don't give it up!! Give it up!!
This is your way
Climbing up walls
"Gas pedal" to the floor
Mountain screams and calls your name

So get it up!! Get it up!!
You go ahead
Spitting out words and fist to the air
Ocean waits for your challenge
Make yourself run faster
Go to the new world

Are you ready?
1! 2! 3! 4!

Don't give it up!! Give it up!!
This is your way
Climbing up walls
"Gas pedal" to the floor
Mountain screams and calls your name

So get it up!! Get it up!!
You go ahead
Spitting out words and fist to the air
Ocean waits for your challenge
Make yourself run faster
Go to the new world

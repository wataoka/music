Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see.
Que Sera, Sera,
What will be, will be.

When I was just a little girl
I asked my Mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty?
Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see.
Que Sera, Sera,
What will be, will be.

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my lover, "What will I be?
Will I have rainbows
Day after day?"
Here's what my lover said.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see.
Que Sera, Sera,
What will be, will be.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see.
Que Sera, Sera,
What will be, will be.

Que Sera, Que Sera.

Someone knockin' sliding paper doors
And you nod in beautiful kimono
Got my heartbeat fly away to Seoul
I love you!

Oh, lord! Why were we raised up in
Faraway other lands?

Never met a girl like you before
Made up my mind honeymoon to Kyoto
There I cut my hair into the bald
Hold on, girl!

Oh, lord! Why were we raised up in
Faraway other lands?

Sailing high with the Japanese girl
CALIFORNIA DREAMIN', NEVERMIND
Sailing high with the Japanese girl
California dreamin' never across the world

Let your father try to understand
Say you love me
Let your mother
Never make you say Sayonara
Say you love me
Sayonara
Sailing high with the Japanese girl
CALIFORNIA DREAMIN', NEVERMIND
Sailing high with the Japanese girl
CALIFORNIA GIRLS can never die

Fall in love with the Japanese girl
CALIFORNIA DREAMIN', NEVERMIND
Fall in love with the Japanese girl
California dreamin' never across the earth

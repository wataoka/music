Do you remember?
That beautiful day
You and me
Fell in love
You took my hand
And it felt so warm
In chilly skies of hope
I remember
Do you feel the same?
I wanna feel you next to me
Forever, I believe
All I need is your love
I'll give you my heart

Sometimes love makes me cry
When you've gone away
Please don't make me feel alone
I will do anything for you
You know. I will always be your girl
Cause, I will always be your friend

When you aren't around me baby all I think about is you
I can't find the way to get you out of my mind boy
When you aren't around me all I care about is you
And you know I miss you everyday more and more

Do you remember?
When I came to know
That we're so meant to be
The only thing I could do was to pray
That I would see you again
I remember
When I touch your hand
I can feel you close to me
Forever, I believe
All I need is your love
I give you my heart

Sometimes you are so brave
And oh, so fragile
I won't make you feel alone
If no one tries to understand
You know I'll always be your side
Cause I will always be your friend

When you aren't around me baby all I think about is you
I can't find the way to get you out of mind boy yeah
When you aren't around me all I care about is you
I feel strong when are together
If scares me oh

Every time, everywhere
When I'm with you
Anythiing goes
I hated this world
You changed my life
To love this world
You gave me light
You're my savior, Ah

People make so many promises
And how many of them are kept?
Cause' we always forget the important things
I don't wanna break them anymore
The days you made me smile
The days we walked hand in hand
Memories never fade away
I can't live a day without you
And you're my everything to me Ah

Do you remember?
That beautiful day
You and me
Fell in love
You took my hand
And it felt so warm
In chilly skies of hope
I remember
Do you feel the same?
I wanna feel you next to me
Forever, I believe
All I want is your love
When I came to know
That we're so meant to be
The only thing I could do was to pray
That I would see you again
I remember
When I touch your hand
I can feel you close to me
Forever, I believe
All I need is your love
I give you my heart

I will always be your girl
I will always be there...

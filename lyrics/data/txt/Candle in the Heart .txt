The warm glow to light up this darkness,
the candle in your hear, soul
From the moment the light was lit,
it keeps on flickering

Ah, what if this light in your heart could
Cast a light on all sadness in this world

The candle in your hear is flickering softly

A single wish to wish upon,
while candle light shines on
If it comes true,
let me be a light to shine upon you

Ah what if I were you and you were me
Only if I could, picture that, would this world

Be little more peaceful and filled with smiles

Ah, what if this light in your heart can
Cast a light on all sadness in this world
I would only want to keep burning on

We each have our own,
a candle in our heart
With your soft glow,
please keep shining on

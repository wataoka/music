We'd like to make it
When there's nothing in this world
We got the burning
And it's deep within our soul
Groove Along
Got to let you know

So nice to meet you
We'll be rockin' you all night
Let's get together
In a milky way of light
Groove along
Let yourself go wild

Groove along with us, baby（show me what you do）
Come along with us, now（It won't do you no harm）
Groove along with us, baby
Honey, won't you show me how you do it shake your hips and bones

Cause I feel like groovin' on
Would you like to come along?
Make me feel like groovin' on

So nice to meet you
I'll be rockin' you all night
Let's get together
In a milky way of light
Groove along
Let yourself go wild

Won't you love me up, baby（Show me what you do）
Come along with me, now（Come along and hitch a ride）
Groove along with me, baby
Baby, baby, show me how you do it shake your hips and bones

（Do it shake）Cause I feel like groovin' on
（Do it shake）Would you like to come along?
（Do it shake）Step on up and move along
（Do it shake）Make me feel like groovin' on
（Do it shake）Cause I feel like groovin' on

Can't you see that I've been waitin'?
For you, anticipatin'
It's not a game I'm playin'

I've been to shy to say it
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
I'm ready now please listen

If you were mine I'd never hurt you no no no
I had to be sure
Never felt like this before
Love or just lust
There's somethin' between us
I wanna give you all of my trust

I've always played the same part
Left only with half a heart
I'm ready for a new start

Be the one to mend me
The first to apprehend me
I'll be yours for pretending

Lean into me
Wanna feel your love against me
Pure ecstacy
Can't say no to you;"please"only
Start off slowly
Speed it up come closer to me
Whisper softly
Won't you set me free, oh baby

If you were mine I'd never hurt you no no no
I had to be sure
Never felt like this before
Love or just lust
There's somethin' between us
I wanna give you all of my trust

There is no other, You're who I've been waiting for
Eternal lover, Never felt like this before
Love or just lust
There's something between us
I'm ready now to give you my love

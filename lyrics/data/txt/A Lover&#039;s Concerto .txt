How gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow
Birds high upon the trees
Serenade the flowers
With their melodies
See there beyond the hill
The bright color of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us
Just to fall in love

Now I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me
Don't ever make me cry
Through long lonely nights without love
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally

Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above sing once again
You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again, you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

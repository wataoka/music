Moon light, shining through the black night

Carry me away
Carry me far away
Carry me away
Somewhere sincere light shines

Hear the truth, I used to overlook
Finally caught on a hook

Lost all my strength, so long in length
Devoted to who I truly loved

Carry me away
Carry me far away
Carry me away
Not a soul around, alive
Somewhere sincere light shines

Just remember

To believe

In what you see

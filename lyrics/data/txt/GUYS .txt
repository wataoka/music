Some guys try to please you showing off his money
Some guys try to tease you with some silly games

Every man just wants to do it with the next best girl
And the girls they want them too
I don't want my love to be an one night stand
I need someone to satisfy me

I hear you say my name
(Just say it louder)
Let's tell a story about us
Just you and me

Pretty faced baby comes into my mind
Use your hips and wet your lips to make me blind
Pretty faced baby gets into my sea
Take the chance tonight and try to drown in me
A ha ha a ha ahaaa
Pretty faced guy
A ha ha a ha comes into my mind
Pretty faced guy, yeah

Some guys are far too wise to pay for the boring date
Some guys are far too proud to say the words of love aloud

Tell me why does everyone of them make violent moves?
Scares were made by hungry wolves
I don't want a fake affair to erase my mind
I need someone to satisfy me

I wanna taste your flame
(Don't disappoint me)
Let's tell a story about us
Just you and me

Pretty faced baby comes into my mind
Use your hips and wet  your lips to make me blind
Pretty faced baby gets into my sea
Take the chance tonight and try to drown in me
A ha ha

I want the highest feeling
I want my ecstasy
I know you want my skin, so
Don't let it go

Pretty faced baby comes into my mind
Use your hips and wet your lips to make me blind
Pretty faced baby gets into my sea
Take the chance tonight and try to come and take me over
Pretty faced baby comes into my mind
Use your hips and wet your lips to make me blind
Pretty faced baby gets into my sea
Take the chance tonight and try to drawn in me
A ha ha a ha ahaaa
Pretty faced guy
A ha a ha comes into my mind
Pretty faced guy, yeah

I want to hold you when you sleep
Just to hear you when you're dreamin'
And then I'll whisper all the things I'm thinking of

I wanna freeze your kiss in mine
Let me melt the ice between us
Cause my crying time's the moment!
Know I'll have to let you go

One Suitcase
At the door
With my shoes on the floor
I've been here before
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
One Suitcase
And a phone
That won't ring anymore
Is there something I should know
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
The morning after (rpt)

I ran out of words that could explain
All the sentiments feeling
And the harder that I try pushes away every truth

I want hold your hands in mine
We gotta break the chains that bind us
If I'm heading to
a place that you
Know that I don't belong

One Suitcase
At the door
With my shoes on the floor
I've been here before
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
One Suitcase
And a phone
That won't ring anymore
Is there something I should know
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
The morning after (rpt)

It's a heart
With no refrain
Silence just keeps returning
I won't
Let myself feel
Any afterburn
Cause I've tried
To turn around
This mystifying feeling
That our love's a crime
Every time
You don't know what to say

One Suitcase
At the door
With my shoes on the floor
I've been here before
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
One Suitcase
And a phone
That won't ring anymore
Is there something I should know
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
The morning after (rpt)
One Suitcase
At the door
With my shoes on the floor
I've been here before
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
One Suitcase
And a phone
That won't ring anymore
Is there something I should know
Will there be a morning after
Should I stay, or should I go
The morning after (rpt)

One Suitcase
At the door

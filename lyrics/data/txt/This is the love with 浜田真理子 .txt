It's been a night
Turn the lights around me down
Take the slow way
Round the center of the sun
Trying to steal the day
Maybe to be with you

Do you still remember my name
Do you feel the same
Do the things I say make you laugh
Just a laugh from yesterday

Gonna make this love
Don't know where to go but I'm running
I'm gonna make this love
Don't know how to fly but we're soaring

This is the love I need
This is the love, keeping me real
This is the love that I know
It had to be you

It's getting late
When the crowds all start to go
We take the long way
To the corner of the sky
Where you can be with me
Leaving the world below

Will you still remember my name
Will we feel the same
Will the things I say make you laugh
Just a laugh back from yesterday

Gonna make this love
Don't know where to go but I'm running
I'm gonna make this love
Don't know how to fly but we're soaring

This is the love I need
This is the love, Keeping me real
This is the love that I know

Still don't know what I have to say
You're everything I have to need
You make me want to be with you
Your eyes have me in a dream

Gonna make this love
Don't know where to go but I'm running
I'm gonna make this love
Don't know how to fly but we're soaring

This is the love I need
This is the love, Keeping me real
This is the love that I know

Gonna make this love
Gonna make this love

TV is on, and I am talking on the phone
PC is left on too, all at the same time
No space on the floor, I could open a store
It's almost four, questions on my mind

If I lose'em all, what would happen to me?
Ain't no sleepless night, it ain't gon' kill me
If I lose'em all, what would happen to me?
What's the big deal? I am all I need

Tigers following me, spiders watching me
As if they're my friends, waiting for me to sleep
Words they throw at me, are bringing me down
But I'm reaching out, toward a higher ground

If I lose'em all, what would happen to me?
Ain't no sleepless night, it ain't gon' kill me
If I lose'em all, what would happen to me?
What's the big deal? I am all I need

Just throw them away
Take all away
Too heavy if you wanna win the game

Take it if you want (Bring it on!)

Just throw them away
Take all away
They got a better place to go anyway
Get out of my way
Take it if you want

Just throw them away
Take all away
Too heavy if you wanna win the game
Get out of my way
Take it if you want (That"Fre@K $HoW")

Just throw them away

They got a better place to go anyway
Get out of my way
Take it if you want (Bring it on!)

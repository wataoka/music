I WONDER HOW
EVEN A CROWDED STREET
CAN SEEM SO HAUNTED

THESE BOULEVARDS
OF BROKEN HEARTS
AVENUES OF THE UNWANTED

BUT WORST OF ALL
THE GHOST OF OUR LOVE
SEEMS TO HANG SUSPENDED

CAN THIS BE OUR FATE?

IF I COULD CHANGE ONE YESTERDAY
IF I COULD PAY FOR ONE MISTAKE
MAYBE I'D HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN, BACK TO STAY
BUT NOW THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO BLAME
AND THERE'S NO WORDS LEFT TO SAY
WISH I COULD TRADE ONE YESTERDAY FOR TODAY

UNDER THE SUN
I WALK ALONG
JUST LIKE A LONELY SHADOW

I TURN MY HEAD
THERE'S NO REFLECTION
IN THE CAFE WINDOW

I'VE WASTED ALL OUR YESTERDAYS
TILL THERE WAS NO TOMORROW

CAN IT BE TOO LATE?

IF I COULD CHANGE ONE YESTERDAY
IF I COULD PAY FOR ONE MISTAKE
MAYBE I'D HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN, BACK TO STAY
BUT NOW THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO BLAME
AND THERE'S NO WORDS LEFT TO SAY
WISH I COULD TRADE ONE YESTERDAY FOR TODAY

JUST ONE YESTERDAY
IS ALL I NEED TO
CHANGE THE WEATHER
MAKE IT BETTER

CAN THIS BE OUR FATE?

IF I COULD CHANGE ONE YESTERDAY
IF I COULD PAY FOR ONE MISTAKE
MAYBE I'D HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN, BACK TO STAY
BUT NOW THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO BLAME
AND THERE'S NO WORDS LEFT TO SAY
WISH I COULD TRADE ONE YESTERDAY FOR TODAY

IF I COULD CHANGE ONE YESTERDAY
IF I COULD PAY FOR ONE MISTAKE
MAYBE I'D HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN, BACK TO STAY
BUT NOW THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO BLAME
AND THERE'S NO WORDS LEFT TO SAY
WISH I COULD TRADE ONE YESTERDAY FOR TODAY

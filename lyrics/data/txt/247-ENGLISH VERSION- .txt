BETTER GET A GRIP, I'M IN A DREAM DIORAWA
GOTTA GIVE IT UP, IT'S TOO SERENE, IT'S A PAINLESS DRAMA
GOT A LUCK BANGLE MAKE A WISH, A LITTLE TRAUMA
YOU NEVER CALL ME BACK, YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE... KARMA?

I DON'T WANNA VIRTUAL HAPPINESS ANYMORE

I WANNA TAKE YOU AWAY!
WANNA SAY IT IN REALITY, BUT MY WORDS GET IN THE WAY
I'VE GOT DESIRE INSIDE
FILL MY HEART, SOUL WITH MELODY
BEAUTIFUL SOUND, ALL AROUND

I'VE BEEN IN A PLACE, IT'S OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION
CRAZY WORLD I CAN'T CONTROL, WITH NO CONFRONTATION
I'M KIND OF LAME AND BROKEN DOWN, DESPERATION
CROSSING OUT ANOTHER"X"PLANATION

I DON'T WANNA VIRTUAL HAPPINESS ANYMORE

I WANNA TAKE YOU AWAY!
WANNA SAY IT IN REALITY, BUT MY WORDS GET IN THE WAY
I'VE GOT DESIRE INSIDE
FILL MY HEART, SOUL WITH MELODY
BEAUTIFUL SOUND, ALL AROUND

TAKE IT A LITTLE EASY, IT'S THE FIRST TIME, NO PAIN, NO GAIN
IT'S ABOUT TIME TO CROSS THE LINE, SO COME ALIVE, GO DIVE!

I WANNA TAKE YOU AWAY!
WANNA SAY IT IN REALITY, BUT MY WORDS GET IN THE WAY
I'VE GOT DESIRE INSIDE
FILL MY HEART, SOUL WITH MELODY
BEAUTIFUL SOUND, ALL AROUND

YES! GOTTA TAKE YOU AWAY!
I'M GONNA SAY I'M ALIVE, SO HERE I GO, I'M GONNA DIVE!
I'VE GOT A DESIRE INSIDE
FILL MY HEART, SOUL WITH MELORY
24/7 WON'T BE ENOUGH, CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME SONG...

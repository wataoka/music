Stop to think before you
Hold on to your realities
Nothing compares to someone true
Close, so close beside you
Carry your instincts
Love that shines consciously
So clearly to see
For who hold inside

You hurt but learn
Your poor but strong
You laugh and turn
I recommend those occasions

You love but loose
You need but hurt
You hold and pose
I recommend those occasions

I really would want
Something I can care
For a while if your the best
Then we can hope to see the rest

＊Stop to think before you
　Hold on to your realities
　Nothing compares to someone true
　Close, so close beside you
　Carry your instincts
　Love that shines consciously
　So clearly
　Only flows inside

You brake but share
Your wrong but clear
You feel and care
I recommend those occasions

You know but shove
Your tears but cute
You cry and love
I recommend those occasions

Can't take me away
Somewhere I won't be
For my life it's just one test
I'll make my dreams the best

（＊repeat）

Stop to think before you
Hold on to your realities
Nothing compares to someone true
Close, so close beside you
Carry your instincts
Love that shines consciously
So clearly to see
Is one flow inside

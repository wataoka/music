From a higher sky 
Sometimes like a sweet moving cloud 
Sometimes like a dearest sister 
Sometimes like a free bird 

From a deeper sea 
Sometimes like a pretty ripple 
Sometimes like a fish swimming delightfully around the sea 

Someone watching me 
Someone watching you 
When you are abandoned and alone too 
Undoubtedly they are watching us all the time 
Never forsake 


We were born alone 
We will die alone 
We know we are alone 
Still we all share this world . we can share 
That is all and true 

We share the song 
We share the love 
When you are abandoned and alone too 
Undoubtedly we are sharing all the time 
We never leave

We can rise , rise again 
Over and over again 
Even if you are badly hurt and break down 

We can rise , rise again 
Over and over again 
We rise again 

We share the song 
We share the love 
When you are abandoned and alone too 
Undoubtedly we are sharing all , all the time 
We never leave 

We share the song 
We share the love forever…

…I never leave…

You could've said a word but you turned away
Why do you always act such a passive way?
Don't you ever think that I would
suck up to you
But I still believe in you

When I was given freedom, oh all
I did was flee,
when I turn back there was nothing to see
You closed your doors before
I could open mine
Now I know now I see it was a waste of time

The days go by you never seem to learn to fly
And all you do is find the reason why
And all I wished for was for you to face your dreams
I still believe that you can fly

When I was given passion, oh I tried to cool it down,
Till I found out, I couldn't say the words I wanted to say
You are the sun to lighten up my shadows, saved me
And never let it go

You could've said a word but you turned away
Why do you always act such a passive way?
Don't you ever think that I would
suck up to you
But I still believe in you

There's no way I can talk to who you were ten days ago
Cuz you are who you are now

When I was facing reality I lived in fantasy,
Till I put it aside in the space between you and me
If only I could reach the voice in the water
Take me there, it's gonna be much better

As days go by we all need to learn to fly
If only I didn't care about the reason why
And all I wished for was for you to meet
my dreams
I still believe that we can fly

I'm just waithing for you to stand up to it
what are you waithing for?

The days go by you never seem to learn to fly
And all you do is find the reason why
And all I wished for was for you to face your dreams
I still believe that you can fly

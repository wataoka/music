Don't wanna do this
Don't wanna do that,too
That's how I lived my life Oh oh
And now I think I'm
Making a huge mistake

I'm gonna hurt you
It's gonna hurt me,too
That's how I see the world Uh uh
And if you think it's
Too hard to bear I'll be on my way

I know I should say
Something nice
Face to face
If I fail
Are you gonna judge me?

I look in the mirror
All I see's a shell
Buried in the sand
I'm ready to leave it all behind
The future is in my hands yeah

I played my games
The way I wanted and
I always climbed the staires yeah

Although I wish
I had somebody to stand by me

I know I should show
How I feel
But I'm still
Afraid to know the truth about me

I look in the mirror
All see's a girl
Lost in the sea of greed
I'm ready to leave it all behind
The future is in my hands yeah

Put it on my name
I will take the blame
I promise to be strong

I know I can change
All I need's in my hands
I really think I do
There's no looking back

I look in the mirror
All I see's a shell
Buried in the sand
I'm ready to leave it all behind
The future is in my hands yeah

I look in the mirror
All see's a girl
Lost in the sea of greed
I'm ready to leave it all behind
The future is in my hands yeah

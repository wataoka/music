I've got to change my mind, oh girl I change my mind
You know I love you so much girl, it's real
Hold me tight again and you know what I really want you to say
I really want you to say, “oh my lover boy”
“oh my lover boy”
“oh my lover boy”

When I saw a girl on the street,
My eyes was stolen certainly
But I want you to know that you are my sunshine
Oh my sunshine lead me to your heart
So, I've got to change my mind, oh girl I change my mind
You know I love you so much girl, it's real
Hold me tight again and you know what I really want you to say
I really want you to say, “oh my lover boy”

Well I've got to change my mind, oh girl I change my mind
You know I love you so much girl, it's real
Hold me tight again and you know what I really want you to say
I really want you to say, “oh my lover boy”
I really want you to say, “oh my lover boy”
I really want you to say, “oh my lover boy”
I really want you to say, “oh my lover boy”

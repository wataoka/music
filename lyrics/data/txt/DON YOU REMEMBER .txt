So many ways...  So many nights  Like a dream...
You and I  Hold you tight...  A long long time deep inside

So many loves...  You found you're way so easily
It's so easy...  Love's so easy lost in your eyes loving you

Making love... Hold you tight...
Taste your lips...  Sweet sweet night...
Feel your breath...  Hear you cry...
Love's desire...  Deep deep sigh...

You believe...  Love's a paradise of souls
I call your name  through the fire...  We're making love...  All night long...

Midnight sky...  Stars shine bright...
Ocean cries...  Lost in your eyes...
Take my hand...  Untouched land...
Just you and I...  End of time...

Finally... 夢見ていた日々 Honestly...  I believe...
We're destiny 君と…

Making love... Hold you tight...
Taste your lips...  Sweet sweet night...
Feel your breath...  Hear you cry...
Love's desire...  Deep deep sigh...

Midnight sky...  Stars shine bright...
Ocean cries...  Lost in your eyes...
Take my hand...  Untouched land...
Just you and I...  End of time...

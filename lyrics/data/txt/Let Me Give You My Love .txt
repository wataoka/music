What a day, young boy next door passed away
Oh it makes me wanna say
I don't wanna waste another day
Can you and I start mixing gene pools
Eastern, Western people
Get naughty multilingual
I was sort of like soul searching
But your body's so jaw-dropping
Our chemistry's groundbreaking
Don't keep me waiting
(Chorus)
Hurry up, baby hurry up, baby
Let me give you my love
Hurry up, let's turn this room into a melting pot
Giddy up, baby giddy up, baby
Let me give you my love
Buckle up, boy I know you're gonna like what I got
Maybe it's not worth the wait
Maybe I should walk away
I don't wanna waste my energy
Can you and I stop acting like fools
Or move on to other people
It's funny, but I'd like to settle
I was sort of like soul searching
But your body's so jaw-dropping
Some say it's rulebreaking
But times are changing
Chorus

Let me know if what I'm feeling isn't mutual
All I know is that I'm feeling very very hot hot hot
Chorus (2Ã—)

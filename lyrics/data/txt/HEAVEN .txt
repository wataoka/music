Heaven is where we are, where we are
With you, it's never far, never far
Heaven is like a star, like a star
Sky-high but not too far, not too far
I know you are the one
I know you are my love
Heaven is with you

Badabada Boom Badabing Bada Boom!
Tell me what you need and I'll give it to you, boo
Cuz I'm feelin' all of the moves you got
Got me takin' off my clothes cuz I'm super hot
Hello, hello
Wanna hear you before I
C'mon, c'mon
Go to sleep dreamin' of ya
Show me what you got, and I'll give it what I got
Baby, heaven's what we make it
Don't you know it
Gotta live it don't ya stop!

I'm lovin' every minute with you, boy
Got me singing LaLaLa tonight
You give me wings and you give me power to go high
Fly me away

Heaven is where we are, where we are
With you, it's never far, never far
Heaven is like a star, like a star
Sky-high but not too far, not too far
I know you are the one
I know you are my love
Heaven is with you

Don't you worry, my love
Lovin' whatcha do, whatcha whatcha wanna do
Cuz you're acting like you
Never met a girl like me and
Talking like you
Never did a girl like me, so
Kiss me now, hold me now
Heaven is a place inside your heart
Heaven is the place with all of your love

I'm lovin' every minute with you, boy
Got me singing LaLaLa tonight
You give me wings and you give me power to go high
So let us celebrate this love
Sing until we reach the sky above
You give me power, power to go high
Fly me away

Heaven is where we are, where we are
Let's fly away, forever and a day
Heaven's with you now
Heaven is like a star, like a star
Let's fly away until our wings grow old
Fly me away

Heaven is where we are, where we are
With you, it's never far, never far
Heaven is like a star, like a star
Sky-high but not too far, not too far
I know you are the one
Heaven is with you

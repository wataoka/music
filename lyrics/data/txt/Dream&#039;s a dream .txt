Time has come
Dream's a dream

One Friday night
The bell started ringing
I have to go home now
and I know
I'll never be in this dream again

Time has come
Dream's a dream

I'm so sorry
Oh,what should I do?
You have to go home now
and I know
You'll never be in this dream again

Time has come
Dream's a dream

Everything dies away

Time has come
Let sleeping dogs lie

Time has come
Come closer,play in G

Time has come!!

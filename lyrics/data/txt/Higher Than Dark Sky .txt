You're going higher, higher than dark sky,
and I'm standing on this planet, playing for a peace in your mind.
Let me just crying, crying for my love,
and I don't know how to survive, you will always live in my mind.

静かな惑星から 舞い上がり 澄み切った夜空を 突き抜けてゆく
君の飛び立つ姿を 見送ろう 宇宙に広がるエナジーひとつになれ

軌道を追い越して行く ひとすじの光よ

You're flying faster, faster than shooting stars,
and I'm standing on this planet, playing for a peace in your mind.
Let me just shouting, shouting for my love,
and I don't know how to survive, you will always live in my mind.

君がそばで笑ってた 昨日まで 身体中に残る ぬくもりだけ
どうしても手放せない 忘れない これからいくつの夜 数えるだろう

何億光年先に また星が生まれる

You're going higher, higher than dark sky,
and I'm standing on this planet, playing for a peace in your mind.
Let me just crying, crying for my love,
and I don't know how to survive, you will always live in my mind.

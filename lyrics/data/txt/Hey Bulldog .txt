Sheep dog standing in the rain
Bull frog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special
when you smile

Child-like no one understands
Jack knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me you can talk to me
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wig wam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me you can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me

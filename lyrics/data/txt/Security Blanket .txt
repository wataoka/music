I have a box of precious things
Things that can always make me sing
Of the moon and stars and wind
And you make everything

You are the one that makes me smile
And makes my life seem so worthwhile
You make me feel like a child
And give me my own style

And if you ever call on me
Security blanket I can be
Keep from harm
I'll wrap you in my arms

I just can't wait to see your face
And feel the warmth of your embrace
You can brighten up my day
Make sadness melt away

And I get jealous now and then
Everyone wants to be your friend
But I try not to resent
You're with me in the end

You are the one I treasure most
When I'm with you I'm never lost
I always want to have you close

And if you ever call on me
Security blanket I can be
Keep from harm
Wrap you in my arms

Just like each rose will have it's thorns
Our sunny days will have their storms
But then the sun will feel more warm

You are the one I treasure most
When I'm with you I'm never lost
I always want to have you close

And if you ever call on me
Security blanket I can be
Keep from harm
Wrap you in my arms

No matter the hurdles, Life will throw at you
I'll always be ready to help you get through

I can see through the stars
into your heart
So no matter
 where you are its never far
I hold you in my soul,
you'll always be
Here With me forever,you must belive
I am waiting for you
I am waiting for you in my heart


There are these fewtimes
I feel I only for you
But I know
 this shade of blue will'soon pass throngh
I must be strong without you by my side
I can see forever you are my light
I am waiting for you
I am waiting for you in my heart

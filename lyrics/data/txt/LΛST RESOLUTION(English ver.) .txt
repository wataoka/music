One history
Finally, kick in the gate of pain
My resistance
No more chance, can't escape, despair
Break out!

Pain from the dark
Your sneer is only hypocrisy
Well, say it again
I'll be the one still standing tomorrow

Yes, my scars they cut deep, see my“EMBLEM”
So set me, soul on fire
Feel my wrath unleashed and go away!

Only in the darkness can I judge the nature of your crime
I will stop this here and now for all time
I hold the fate of our nation in the palm of my hand
I can take, we can make, getting for new world
LΛST RESOLUTION

So far away
Pushed to the edge, taking a life, can't forget
Try to survive
When it's begun, can't be undone, go ahead!

Fated to this life only it's a“GIFT”
I must follow this path now
Past the point of no return I go!

If I can stop all the betrayal it's the end of our sorrow
Don't give up our day of peace will arrive
We've had enough of this oppression, come now liberation
I got it, we made it unlimited daybreak
LΛST RESOLUTION

Turn on, light up our lives once again
Join with me and create a new world

Only in the darkness can I judge the nature of your crime…

Only in the darkness can I judge the nature of your crime
I will stop this here and now for all time
I hold the fate of our nation in the palm of my hand
I can take, we can make, getting for new world
LΛST RESOLUTION

わがままじゃない
だけど
I know what I need
I won't lie

嘘をつかない
気持ちをかくせない

Midnightから 朝まで
We've been using body language
Surrender your inhibitions
心を開いて
COMMUNICATION!!!

Just your touch is never enough
Never enough, never enough... Yeah
You got a voice so baby speak up,
まだ聴こえない. Yeah
You wanna know what turns me on?
Turn me on, Turn me on... Yeah
Genuine COMMUNICATION
Come talk to me
Talk to me, yeah～

冷めてるわけじゃない
だけど
I use my time wisely
I won't die,
I won't hesitate to say“good-bye”
時間を無駄にしない

Midnightから朝まで
Just your touch and I'm left speechless
Throw away your limitations
心を込めて
COMMUNICATION!!!

Just your touch is never enough
Never enough, never enough... Yeah
You got a voice so baby speak up,
まだ聴こえない. Yeah
You wanna know what turns me on?
Turn me on, Turn me on... Yeah
Genuine COMMUNICATION
Come talk to me
Talk to me, yeah～

Just your touch is never enough
Never enough, never enough... Yeah
You got a voice so baby speak up,
まだ聴こえない. Yeah
You wanna know what turns me on?
Turn me on, Turn me on... Yeah
Genuine COMMUNICATION
Come talk to me
Talk to me, yeah～

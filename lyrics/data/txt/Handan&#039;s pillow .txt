However convinced, they are all failures
How hard you try, nothing's rewarded

Every single thing someone does and says
Everything is a dream in doze

How much you hear, nothing can be helped
How much you deceive, awakening will come

Every single thing someone does and says
Everything is a dream in doze

If you drown yourself enough in the sea of tears
We shall go now
We shall go...go for a seeing off

Everything is a dream in doze...

Handan's pillow

どれだけ思い込んでも 結局は失敗で
どんなに努力をしても 一つも報われず
どれほど耳を傾けても 役立つ事も無く
どこまで誤魔化しても やがて目は覚める

語る始終はつかのまの幻
起る一切はうたた寝の夢

呆れるほど涙に身を沈めたら別れを告げに出かけよう

全ては一瞬の幻

全ては邯鄲の夢

You take it one by one
You take it to the other side
I flip the card and now you can't hide
And you see how I'm really gone
You take it one by one
You flip the card and now
You are turning over and some wind comes thru
And now that you're really gone

You are the sunshine of my day
You are the flower of the field that I play
I'll do anything to make you say
“I wanna kiss you when the lights are down,
We can steal the night away”

You take it one by one
You flip the card and now
You are breathing hard and you take
The feather, taking all into your heart
You take it 2 by 2 and
Now you're into my heart and now
You are showing all of you and now
You are really gone

Oh you could be the sunshine of my day
You are the flower of the field that I play
I'll do anything to make you say
“I wanna kiss you when the lights are down,
We can steal the night away”

I've never felt so happy but now
I know my solitude will end
Oh I could be so happy in your arms
Oh what can I say?

You are the sunshine of my day
You are the flower of the field that I play
I'll do anything to make you say
“I wanna kiss you when the lights are down,
We can steal the night away”

I'm not dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm not dreaming of a white Christmas
All I'm dreaming of the whole day long
Is a peaceful one

Merry Christmas, Happy new year
To those of you who live in fear
And let us hope that very soon
The peace you seek will then resume

I'm not dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm not dreaming of a white Christmas
All I'm dreaming of the whole day long
Is a peaceful, peaceful one

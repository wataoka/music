銀の合鍵そっと渡すわ あなたひとりの招待状よ
I try to keep it
My little Secret
約束は今日ふたりだけの夜

顔に出さないあなたの想い 女の目にはかくせないのよ
Don't try to hide it?
Don't try to fight it?
もうこれ以上待ってられないの

This is an open invitation
I'm planning on a celebration
Ooh baby,for your information
I'm gonna make you fall in love with me

It's not just my imagination
Filling me with anticipation
Come on,give in to the temptation
'Cuz I'm the one you really need

Boy,when it's just you and I
How wonderful it'll be

電話のベルは鳴らさないでね つれない返事ききたくないわ
Don't try to hide it
Don't try to fight it
待たせないでね ふたりだけの夜

This is an open invitation

Come up and see sometime
I'll show you what I mean
Boy,when it's just you and I
How wonderful it'll be!

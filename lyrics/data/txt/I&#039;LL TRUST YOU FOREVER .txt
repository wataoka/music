Ain't nothing gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make it 
I'm running hard and straight ahead 
Can't even take the time to mop 
The sweat that's streamin' like the rain off my head 

Didn't know what I was living for, I couldn't take it 
I stood there with nothing I could believe 
My life was just a mystery 
I hid my heart and soul way up in my sleeve 

Now that we're both together 
Trading lines to help each other understand 
Now I'm awfully glad we got mad at each other at all 

Down and out when U don't know what to do 
That's the time you reach your hand out softly to me 
No way we'll ever be parted again 
We'll be friends, you'll see my eyes are following you 

No matter what the changes the future may bring 
It's you I'll remember always 
I'll trust you forever 

And as I run into the wind, I feel myself reviving 
Blowing the sweat off of me now 
Until I am awakening into a day to make a dream come true 

It could be anybody 
Everyone has got a jewel shining inside 
But if they're covered in fears let the tears 
Wash those troubles away 

Fight on strong until the sun goes down 
Raise your fist and wave it in the air like a flag 
Wounds all over from your head to your toes 
So it goes, but you have learned to laugh through it all 
We lie upon our backs and feel the Earth down below 
And squint at the stars above us. 

Down and out when U don't know what to do 
That's the time you reach your hand out softly to me 
No way we'll ever be parted again 
We'll be friends, you'll see my eyes are following you 

Don't give up! You're gonna make it today 
Move ahead, forever forward and never look back 
You're not alone or by yourself anymore 
You've got someone you can count on everyday. 

No matter what the changes the future may bring 
It's you I'll remember always 
I'll trust you forever 

You'll carry us on

Bring back that setting...
Bring back that setting...
If that's the way you want it
That's the way you'll get it

We're the stereo connection, baby
Oooh that's the way we take control of it
Move up a gear as we break out and branch out
Ha ha ha you better hold on tight to me
How much more do you need? Time to turn it on
When you got nothing to give
You got no life to live
If that's the way you want it
That's the way you'll get it

Set off a spark from that fuse
When I don't know what else to do
Last night was something I could believe in
Bleed in
Restore that dream and I'm free to go
Through a red light green light and I know
That I stole the sun to drop back in the sky tonight

Stereo connection...stereo infection...

Seek and bow down for it now
Seek and bow down for it now
'Cause I'm your motherfucking angel
You might say that the butterfly re-evolved
Ha ha ha we're still the underdog with more bite
Always changing our sting in this animal scene
If that's the way you want it
That's the way you'll get it

Set off a spark from that fuse
When I don't know what else to do
Last night was something I could believe in
Bleed in
Restore that dream and I'm free to go
Through a red light green light and I know
That I stole the sun to burn it over you

Heat, heat, heat, heating you up yeah

Yeah how low can you go and can you love it?
Insert it in your mojo!
Yeah how much do you know and do you hear it?
Oh I'll send a little bit to me too

Set off a spark from that fuse
When I don't know what else to do
Last night was something I could believe in
Bleed in
Resolve that risk when three is four
Through a red light green light and I know
That I stole the sun to drop back in the sky tonight
Set off a spark from that fuse
When I don't know what else to do
Last night was something I could believe in
Bleed in
I say hello to the world that I let go for a while
And I'm coming now from out of the fuse

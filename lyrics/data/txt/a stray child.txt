if you are lost in your way
deep in an awesome story
don't be in doubt and stray
cling to your lonesome folly

now you're too close to the pain
let all the rain go further
come back and kiss me in vain
mother oh do not bother

hear the chorus of pain
taking you back to proper ways
it's so easy to find
if you could remind me

now you are lost in your way
deep in an awesome story
so I will find you again
kiss you for lonesome folly

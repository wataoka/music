I woke up at 4 in the morning
with the sound of my little neighbor was biting something

pitter-patter rainy day
I'll go back to sleep
the little bird is gonna weep
we have to have a talk
'casue something's wrong around us…

みずたまりの なか 沈んでく ゆめ
いま ここに きみが いたなら
ただ わらって 話を するのに

pitter-patter dots on the ground
I'll go back to sleep
the little bird is gonna weep
we have to have a talk
'casue something's wrong around us..

rainy day
I'll see you in the morning

Go straight, take it over
Don't wait, make it louder
There's a reason to say yes
For my pride and brighter days
I'll do my best to be stronger

Don't let the past get you down
Hear the words in the song
I got the pride of the lyrics“STAY GOLD”

Blame?
I don't care
Trust myself, go my way
Don't you understand
Listen to my message!!

Go straight, take it over
Don't wait, make it louder
There's a reason to say yes
For my pride and brighter days
I'll do my best to be stronger

Go straight, take it over
Don't wait, make it louder
Make a run to be the best
All the way from east to west
No one can stop us forever

Hey younger, don't forget!!
The place, the time that we had been impressed
Keep it always in your heart
ROCK YOU!!!!!!

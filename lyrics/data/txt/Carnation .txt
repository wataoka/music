I lied, Last night, To me
夢でただ Flew, I saw you, In my dream
思い知るは Morning, Alone, C'est bon
僕の前の I, See me
Mirror on the white wall

Good morning, my self-deception
愛の色は変わらない carnation, lavender
想い出は1人の rhythm

There's no paper yet today
It's raining, No problem
僕をすり抜ける Time, Goes by, Good-by
思い入れる Letter, I wrote, Unposted
構わない Still raining, Outside
Sitting in the white room

Good morning, my self-affection
愛の色はうすれない carnation, lavender
思い出は愛の prism

The sun goes around and around
No wonder
The moon watches over the ground forever
And I leave my room alone
But without fear

Imagine, the LENNON, Oh the wall
僕を嫌う Clock, Beats 3/4time
揺れる僕の Coffee cup, Soon hot, Soon cold
故に想いは Ups ＆ Downs
Leaving the white room

Hello, my self-portrait
愛に色に燃えるcarnation, lavender
想い出は明日への reason

The sun goes around and around
No wonder
The moon watches over the ground forever
And I'll leave my room tonight
But without fear

救えないあの日が愛に浮かんでは blue
いたいけで奪えない僕の自慢の blue

明日を照らすより
I try, I cry, I smile
僕の前の I, See me
Mirror on the white wall

Good morning, my escalation
愛の色は変わらない carnation, lavender
想い出は1人の rhythm

The sun goes around and around
No wonder
The moon watches over the ground forever
And I leave my room alone without fear
The sun goes down and down and down
The sun comes up and goes round

No wonder
The moon watches over the ground forever
And I leave my room alone
But without fear

Oh, I leave my room alone
But without fear

Fear

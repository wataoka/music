Hey you really need a holiday
But you don't know where to go
No time to go far away
No time to change the flow

Hey you really need to take a break
But you don't know what to do
You don't need tickets taking you to places you'd like to be

Look out your window now it's waiting there outside
Open the door and you're in a simple paradise

Gonna take a little holiday in the sun
Take it easy, have some fun
Just take some time
Let's get carried away

You can find a holiday wherever you go
Good times always shine, you know
So everyone
Come take a holiday in the sun

Hey you really need to get away
Leave your work and stress behind
You don't need to pack up your bags just bring a change of mind

Blue skies are calling you it's gonna be so nice
One step outside and you're in a simple paradise

Gonna take a little holiday in the sun
Take it easy, have some fun
Just take some time
Let's get carried away

You can find a holiday wherever you go
Good times always shine, you know
So everyone
Come take a holiday in the sun

Everybody needs a holiday
Come take a holiday in the sun

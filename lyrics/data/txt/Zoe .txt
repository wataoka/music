A miracle happened
I found you when I was lost
like a diamond in the rough
Whatever happened to us
You let me know my way
like the white moon in the sky

Angels brought you to me
from the reach of farther away
I'm alive in your light
Angels brought you to me
in remembrance of things past
I believe in destiny

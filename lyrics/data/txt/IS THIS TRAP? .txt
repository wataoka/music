Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? Let me know
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? I don't know

ふと映る Every move
奪われてる My eyes on you
いつか経験する
Thinkin' of you Thinkin' of you

Midnight Tokyo Let's get the party show
弾けるでしょう All night long
甘い罠だと 解っているけど
こうなったのも そう All because of you

I can't sleep I can't breathe I can't take it no more
酔わされた夏の日に
こんなにも Lose control 信じられない Like a trap
Is this trap? This is trap Let me know
You are my Dream Is this trap? I don't know

Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? Let me know
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? I don't know

まだ残る感覚 刺激が誘惑する
ここにしかない Only one
Thinkin' of you Thinkin' of you

Midnight Tokyo Let's get the party show
弾けるでしょう All night long
甘い罠だと 解っているけど
こうなったのも そう All because of you

I can't sleep I can't breathe I can't take it no more
酔わされた夏の日に
こんなにも Lose control 信じられない Like a trap
Is this trap? This is trap Let me know
You are my Dream Is this trap? I don't know

Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? Let me know
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? I don't know

溶かしてく 蒸し暑い現実を
触れた人だけが解る
That's why I thi-i-ink of you

Midnight Tokyo Let's get the party show
弾けるでしょう All night long
甘い罠だと 解っているけど
こうなったのも そう All because of you

I can't sleep I can't breathe I can't take it No more
酔わされた夏の日に
こんなにも Lose control 信じられない Like a trap
Is this trap? This is trap Let me know
You are my Dream Is this trap? I don't know

Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? Let me know
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? I don't know

Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? Let me know
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh
Is this trap? I don't know

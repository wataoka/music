もうキスの温度だけで そう熱く溶けてしまう
帰る時間も忘れて 帰る家も忘れ
光る汗 君の肌を滑る

華奢な体に何度も 僕のことを教えたいよ
それだけで 分かり合える世界

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.
Just Can't Wait To Spend Some Time & Day With You.
Yeah Baby, You're Special Part Of Me.
これ以上 愛はないから

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.
Just Can't Wait To Spend Some Time & Day With You.
Yeah Baby, How Much I Love You Sugar.
分別 なんて邪魔だよ

もう二人身につけてる そう名前さえも脱いで
縛り付けてる不安が 君の肌にくい込む
ほどくから 僕の腕に踊れ

シャワーに濡れた髪ごと 愛し合いたい夜だろう
目覚めるよ 誰も知らない君が

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.
Just Can't Wait To Spend Some Time & Day With You.
Yeah Baby, You're Special Part Of Me.
傷つく 愛は衝動

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.
Just Can't Wait To Spend Some Time & Day With You.
Yeah Baby, How Much I Love You Sugar.
吐息を もっと注いで

Give Me Your Love. Show Me Your Love.
I'm Gonna Be A Slave To Your Love.
You Gonna Pump Me Up Tonight.
Give Me Your Love. Show Me Your Love.
I'm Gonna Be A Slave To Your Love.
You Gonna Pump Me Up Tonight.

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.
Just Can't Wait To Spend Some Time & Day With You.
Yeah Baby, You're Special Part Of Me.
傷つく 愛は衝動

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.
Just Can't Wait To Spend Some Time & Day With You.
Yeah Baby, How Much I Love You Sugar.
吐息を もっと注いで

Give Me Your Love. Show Me Your Love.

傷つく 愛は衝動

I'm Falling, Falling In Love With You.

I close my eyes and
遥か遠くに見える空
限りない夢を詰め込んで 今旅立つ
Winter or Spring Summer or Fall
気付かずに 不安を隠してた

Won't you take me in your heart
交わす言葉 暗い道 照らす
You will always have the key to my heart
通り雨が 優しさに変わる

ねぇ 悲しみがあるから 強くなれる
君と行くよ 明日への果てしない旅

Won't you take me in your heart
I only I only want to be with you
You will always have the key to my heart
I only I only want to be with you

Baby you're the key to me
Open up and you will see
I'll always be right there
You know I will, and you know care
Don't need a fancy car
I like you just the way you are
You know it's plain to see
that you're the only one for me

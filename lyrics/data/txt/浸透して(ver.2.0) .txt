This is gonna be a warning,
I wish you could stop complaing a long time ago.
Now I will go where ever
I want to get my right place in my life...
I am ready to fight...

Every memory I remembered
communicated with each other in my world.
But something or someone
scheme to lead me somewhere wrong.
I have to have strong mind and soul...

I will not be a fake to you..  I swear..
I'll never be a fake to people who I love..
I'll never show you the real if you make me hate you..
I can't be a fake to myself....

This is gonna be a last chance,
all those your excuses are not working... anymore...

Every memory I remembered

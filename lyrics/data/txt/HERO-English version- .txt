All of my life, you never left me behind
You saved the world for me
And now I know that you're my HERO

I know you hear me deep inside
I'll always be right by your side
It's you're morning glow
That carried me right through tomorrow

I always knew that I could fly
But never learned to say goodbye
I'd move the world for you
And now I know I have no power at all
How could I have been so wrong
Finding I was never strong
I was only a moments away
And now I'm lost so far away
If I could bring you back you'd know
That I would never let you go
I'm a man who lost the fight
Even with the Speed of light

I promised all of my life
I'm never leaving you behind
You mean the world to me
And now you're gone there's no tomorrow
If I could tell you one last time
You were the love of my life
I wanted nothing more
Turn out the light
I've lost my HERO

I walk the line I can't retrace
Can't put a smile upon my face
I'll find the missing clue
To carry me right through tomorrow
Wait how could I have been so blind
I could turn back the hands of time
I'll turn the world around
Cause now I know the power to save them all

How could I have been so wrong
Forgetting I was strong
A second chance to save her life
I'll change the world this one last time
I find the might deep in my soul
Then I will never let you go
I found my part here with mankind
Time to fly the Speed of light

I promised all of my life
I'm never leaving you behind
You mean the world to me
So now I have to save tomorrow
And this is not the one last time
That you're the love of my life
I wanted nothing more
Turn on the light
I found my HERO

I am only a man who's searching
For a way to walk just like you
No need for a red costume

I promised all of your life
I'm never leaving you behind
You mean the world to me
You're my HERO

All of my life, you never left me behind
You saved the world for me
And now I know that you're my HERO
You're my HERO
(You're faster than a plane)
(You're faster than a train)
You save me everytime
You mean the world to me
And now you're here
I found my HERO

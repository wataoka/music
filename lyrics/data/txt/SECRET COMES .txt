過ぎ去った...
おびえてる
時計の針 心臓の様に
重なる現実は
眠りにつくと もう戻れない

SECRET COMES×2
Carry on my heart beats goes on
Even days
Movin' on
Please don't stop
be honest who you
SECRET COMES×2
Just my way
must be go my own
Even days
Movin' on
Please don't stop
be honest who you are

どうやって 今
思い出と瞬間
これからつなげてく
秘めている
革命と孤独が
強さを育ててく

SECRET COMES×2
Carry on my heart beats goes on
Even days
Movin' on
Please don't stop
be honest who you
SECRET COMES×2
Just my way
must be go my own
Even days
Movin' on
Please don't stop
be honest who you are

SECRET COMES...

SECRET COMES×2
Carry on my heart beats goes on
Even days
Movin' on
Please don't stop
be honest who you
SECRET COMES×2
Just my way
must be go my own
Even days
Movin' on
Please don't stop
be honest who you are

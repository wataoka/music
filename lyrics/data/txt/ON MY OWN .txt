The sun is shining and I am rising
I'm walking down the path I chose
No more waiting
And no more excuses
Cuz now I can go out on my own

There's more to this life than I've ever thought
Different feelings go through me now
My hearts racing
When I'm by that boy
I guess that I am growing up now

And now I'm on my own

Oh yeah
I'll do whatever I want now
It's all mine to take ooh woah
Oh yeah I'll be whatever I want now
And we're still growing up

And now I'm on my own
I'm different than before

Oh yeah
I'll do whatever I want now
It's all mine to take ooh woah
Oh yeah
I'll be whatever I want now

Oh yeah
I'll do whatever I want now
It's all mine to take ooh woah
Oh yeah
I'll be whatever I want now
(And we're still growing up x5)

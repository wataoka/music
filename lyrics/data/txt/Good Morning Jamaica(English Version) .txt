Good morning Jamaica
You always wait for me to wake up
To your beauty I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you
Good morning Jamaica
Your smile gives me pleasure
So in your arms I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you

I'm breezing the night away
in to more than just another day
So blessed by your grace
Cuz, even through my trouble days
and darkest times I'll see your face
Right a so,
Wi a live like a soldier
When will this war be over?
Cuz, over and over you pray
When will you get to see a new day?

Good morning Jamaica
You always wait for me to wake up
To your beauty I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you
Good morning Jamaica
Your smile gives me pleasure
So in your arms I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you

Send me your rain
Wet my soul to wash away the pain
So I'll be free baby
Oh I can see that
Everything in life is just so beautiful
Don't you know,
Will never be just a dreamer
Set me free I'm no prisoner
Cuz, over and over I pray
Will I ever see a new day?

Good morning Jamaica
You always wait for me to wake up
To your beauty I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you
Good morning Jamaica
Your smile gives me pleasure
So in your arms I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you

Oh please, please don't you go for so long
Dry my eyes in paradise, cry no more

Is this world a cycle?
It goes
Let it go!

Good morning Jamaica
You always wait for me to wake up
To your beauty I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you
Good morning Jamaica
Your smile I will my treasure
In your arms I surrender
Cuz, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

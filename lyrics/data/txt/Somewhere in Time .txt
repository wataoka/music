Somewhere in time
I know I've met you
Was it a day, a month,a thousand years ago
Locked in my mind
There lies a memory
A world of you and me,That we used to know

Somewhere in time
I know I've kissed you
Could I be wrong
Let's kiss, so there will be no doubt
Give me a sign
That you remember
That timeless place, that I've been talking about

Somewhere in time
I've seen your smile
I've known your warmth
your laugh
your tears
the touch of your hand

Somewhere in time
I know I've loved you
Somewhere in time

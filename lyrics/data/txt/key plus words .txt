hide and seek it wants to play again
like a detective, I won't let it get away
it's constantly costuming with loads of fake
I will strip search if I have to
no I'm not afraid to know it no no no
I am so determined
to chase after what's hidden
and seize this day
this moment

(wanna know)
ENTER KEY to accelerate
(wanna go)
ignition turned on
it's about the time to drive to truth
(wanna sieze)
stranger than any movies
(wanna see)
ignorance is not bliss
(they say that truth will out)
(can't keep on hiding)
there's no turning back now
I'm gonna go on
I'm gonna go get what I want

myst is covering my peripheral vision
but my determination is mind blowing
it’s so blatant I won’t be a bit timid
it can trick you and there won’t be any treat
no I’m not afraid to find out no no no
so eager so hungry
to seek out secret
can you conceal it?
when I am after you

(wanna know)
ENTER WORDS to activate
(wanna go)
one more piece to go
it’s about the time to fill it in
(wanna seize)
stranger than any novels
(wanna see)
ignorance is not bliss
(they say that truth will out)
(can't keep on running)
there's no turning back now
I'm gonna go on
I'm gonna go get what I need

I wanna know
even it may hurt
even it brings pain within
my mind’s determined
I need to know
even it may kill
even it may change me
ready to face truth

(wanna know)
ENTER KEY to accelerate
(wanna go)
ignition turned on
it's about the time to drive to truth
(wanna seize)
stranger than any movies
(wanna see)
ignorance is not bliss
(they say that truth will out)
I'm gonna go on
and gonna keep it "ON"

(wanna know)
ENTER WORDS to activate
(wanna go)

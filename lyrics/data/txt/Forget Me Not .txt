Listen to my plan to call him back
'cause I'm very bored
Things seem so simple
except love and what Heaven knows
But I know the trick of finding him
even in a beehive yeah
Hackneyed phrases can be used today as downers
Deadly weapon and words are the same for lovers
you'll see I know the magic
of making him miss me
at the daylight yeah
Under the bed I hid
forget me not
everywhere he can smell
forget me not
forget me not
forget me not yeah woo
forget me not yeah yeah…
forget me not
If he forgets me,
am I supposed to forget him too?
He never promises me
so I can never blame what he'll do
I hope the scent of
forget me not
will make him really uptight yeah…
tu tul tu tu tul tu tu tu…
Under the bed I hid
forget me not
everywherehe can smell
forget me not
forget me not
forget me not yeah woo
forget me not yeah yeah…
forget me not yeah…
forget me not yeah yeah…
forget me not yeah woo
forget me not yeah yeah…
forget me not yeah…

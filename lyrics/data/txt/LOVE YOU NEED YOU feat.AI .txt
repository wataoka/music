Uhhh Uhhh Uhhh

I've got a feelin' in my heart
There's so much love for you
There's not an ocean that's wide
As this love I have for you

When the sun comes up in the morning, baby
You're the first thing on my mind

I love you, need you
Everytime I think about you
I just feel good about it
I love you
Everytime I talk about you
I just feel good about it
I love you night & day
You know my love won't fade away

I've got a feelin' in my heart
There's so much love for you
There's not a mountain too high
For this love I have for you

Whenever you need me
Just call my name and I'll be there

When the sun goes down in the evening, baby
You're the last thing on my mind

I love you, need you
Everytime I think about you
I just feel good about it
I love you
Everytime I talk about you
I just feel good about it
I love you night & day
You know my love won't fade away

Just wanna be with you
Every night & day
Don't wanna miss a thing
Cause you came and took my breath away

Uhhh Uhhh Uhhh

I've got a feelin' in my heart
There's so much love for you

When the sun comes up in the morning, baby
When the sun goes down in the evening, baby
You're the first (last) thing on my mind

I love you, need you
Everytime I think about you
I just feel good about it
I love you
Everytime I talk about you
I just feel good about it
I love you night & day
You know my love won't fade away

I love you, need you
Everytime I think about you
I just feel good about it
I love you, need you
Everytime I think about you
I just feel good about it

I love you, need you
Everytime I think about you
I just feel good about it
I love you
Everytime I talk about you
I just feel good about it
I love you night & day
You know my love won't fade away

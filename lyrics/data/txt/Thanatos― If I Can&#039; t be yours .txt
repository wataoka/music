Now it's time
I fear to tell 
I've been holding it back so long 
But something strange deep inside of me is happening 
I feel unlike
I've ever felt
And it's makin' me scared
That I may not be what I ( think I am ) 

What of us
what do I say
Are we both from a different world
Cos every breath that I take, I breathe it for you
I couldn't face my life without you
And I'm so afraid. 
There's nothing to comfort us
What am I, if I can't be yours 


I don't sleep, 
don't feel a thing
And my senses have all but gone
Can't even cry from the pain, can't shed a tear now
I realise
We're not the same
and it's makin' me sad
Cos we can't fulfil our dream ( in this life ) 

So I must, let us break free
I can never be what you need
If there was a way, through the hurt
Then I would find it
I'd take the blows. Yes I would fight it
But this is the one. Impossible dream to live
What am I, if I can't be yours.

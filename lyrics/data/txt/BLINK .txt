Die with me. That's to know.
Deal with it. Lead a new day.
Come with me. Come with me.
Come with me. Come with me.

God created Defined all.
Extended the Universe.
Shed light below.
Had given uw birth.
In the name of God's Law
We are transitory. Feeding the doves

I know that He knows
I know that He knows

Tomorrow, paper money turns to waste.
They'd keep killing each other.
The Sun goes down. This star evaporates.
The coffee stain The sheep brains
Aheavy rain Falling in love.
His Will exists still

Die with me. That's to know.
Deal with it. Lead a new day.
Come with me. Come with me.
Come with me. Come with me.

There was Fate.
Everything is in His plan.
The Blink of God
That instant
Still we live on.
Linger on.
Searching new dreams.
To touch our future.

I know that He knows
I know that He knows

Still we live on.…

Die with me. That's to know.
Deal with it. Lead a new day.
Come with me. Come with me.
Come with me. Come with me.

Come with me.
Come with me.
Come with me.

Come with me.
Come with me.
Come with me.

Still we live on.…

Come with me.
Come with me.
Come with me.

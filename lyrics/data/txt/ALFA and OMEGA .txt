Alfa and Omega
As in the beginning it will be in the end
Alfa and Omega
We will find our home again
Alfa and Omega
It's our source and it is also our destiny
Alfa and Omega
We will live on earth again

Gently, waiting for centuries in time
We look through space to find our fate again
We long for “Thee”
Our Mother Earth, where we belong,
Amongst colours full of life-impressions
In vivid harmony...
Through darkness and stars
We'll someday find our way to you
To remember all your hidden treasures
And feel the sun, alive...

Alfa and Omega
As in the beginning it will be in the end
Alfa and Omega
We will find our home again
Alfa and Omega
It's our source and it is also our destiny
Alfa and Omega
We will live on earth again

Aaah aah Breathing that pure, fresh air again
Living in mountains, seas, and plains of green...
We long for “Thee”
Our Mother Earth, where we belong
Amongst colours full of life-impression
In vivid harmony...
Your cascades will pour
The water that your clouds will bring
And we'll swim inside your swollen oceans
Reflections of our sun
（the sun）
Swim in better rays of sun
（our sun）
The goldness of our sun
（the sun）

Through darkness and stars
We'll someday find our way to you
To remember all your hidden treasures
（our sun）
And feel the sun alive
Feel the sun alive

A better sun

I wanna be close to you.
I wanna be close to you.
But you don't become aware of me.

Do you understand? Oh yeah, Do you understand?
Looking at your face makes me peaceful.

Do you really believe?
Loving from the bottom of my heart changes sight at all.
I always see your smile from far place.

I found it changed my world.
I found it beat my heart.
Thank you for your million smiles so innocent.
I found it changed my world.

I found it changed my world.
I found it beat my heart.
Thank you for your million smiles so innocent.
I found it changed my world.

I found it changed my world.
I found it beat my heart.
Thank you for your million smiles so innocent.
I found it changed my world.

I wanna be close to you.
I wanna be close to you.
But you don't become aware of me.

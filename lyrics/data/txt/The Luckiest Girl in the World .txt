Another night
Another date
The same old Starbucks with a brand new face
But he made me smile
Knew what to say
Something was different that day

No awkward silence
No monotone
No moment wishing he'd just drive me home
A kiss goodnight
That magic glow
I guess when it's right you know

No man has ever made me feel this way
Now I can finally say

I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
Don't mean to brag but it has to be heard
It's going straight to my head
So I'm shamelessly spreading the word
That I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD

Another night
Another date
Romantic dinner at our favourite place
A perfect match
Is finally made
Both so in love and unafraid

No man has ever made me feel this way
Now I can finally say

I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
Don't mean to brag but it has to be heard
It's going straight to my head
So I'm shamelessly spreading the word
That I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL (IN THE WORLD)

We fall more and more in love every day
It's not coincidence, yeah we call it fate
I thought I'd be alone forever
And never have the pleasure to say...

I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
Don't mean to brag but it has to be heard
It's going straight to my head
So I'm shamelessly spreading the word

I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
Don't mean to brag but it has to be heard
It's going straight to my head
So I'm shamelessly spreading the word
That I'm the LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD

Another night
Another date

あかれ あかれや もののね Let it go いざなへ とわへ
あはれ あはれは よのゆめ Let it go いざなへ とわへ

Go let it out Don't keep your hurt down, hurt down
Food in your mouth Don't keep it all down, all down, down
Give me the light
Fighting your doubt It keeps your pain down, pain down
The truth will out Don't beat yourself down Don't you drown

No ghost in the machine Go and let the sequence play and listen
You know it can be seen Like a light refracted through a prism

Jump in Into the fray
Tumble and roll in the light of the day
Step out into technicoloured wildlife I say
Come and step out of the night
And hold me near Your passionate drum
Throbbing between your stomach, your brain, and your heart
Don't you fear The heat of the sun The planets colliding
Come and step out of the dark

No ghost in the machine Go and let the sequence play and listen
You know it can be seen Like a light refracted through a prism
The protein in the meat Breathing life into this organism
The soul behind the beat Is a light refracted through a prism

Give me the light

Love bites...tell me about it
Got bitten by the bedbugs, that's enough for me, yeah

Can't believe you chose your friend over me
Just because I'm not a guy
Can't believe you chose new friends over me
Just because I'm not a guy
Is it just because I'm not a guy?

Can't believe you chose your friend over me
Just because I'm not a guy
Can't believe you chose new friends over me
Just because I'm not a guy
Is it just because I'm not a guy?

Can't believe
Can't believe it
Can't believe
Can't believe it
I'm a princess incognito

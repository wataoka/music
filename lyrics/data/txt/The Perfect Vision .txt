Close to summertime I'm saying bye-bye
Now I know that it's a lie, the promises

Tell me the reason baby, why ? you're out of your mind
One last time I reminisce, but I say “no more cry”
I know it's not worth giving a try show me the “pride”
I don't wanna be the one to tell you that
you need to step said (Oh baby)
but I'm better off alone, without you in my life

Easily we sing and we feel beat
If you know the words to the song
get your freak on now to the rhythm
Come on ! I'll be your lead take my hand so
We can be top of lady, Don't you see ?
(No No !) stand up again (No No !) I'll take you there
All you gotta do is follow me to my way

Get up and dance look around it's paradise
Hit the floor and baby rock your body, mind, and soul on to the beat
Spin around we are bound to the sound
The groove and the mood is on replay another day
Ready to dance with me (Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !)
Let's get it out and be free (Who ! Who ! Who !)
Before you change your mind, please tonight'll be alright
'Cuz the light will be bright like a new day

So look into my eyes you're one of a kind
Time goes by, now everything we drain it all down why ?
Me tell no lie
Don't wanna know, think I've been here before, sometime ago
I just need to fly high and high where I belong
'cuz the sky is “the perfect place”
Reach out to the limit “catch”
Just leave it to the fate I ain't got nobody to wait

Easily we sing and we feel beat
If you know the words to the song
get your freak on now to the rhythm
Come on ! I'll be your lead take my hand so
We can be top of lady, Don't you see ?
(No No !) stand up again (No No !) I'll take you there
All you gotta do is follow me to my way

Get up and dance look around it's paradise
Hit the floor and baby rock your body, mind, and soul on to the beat
Spin around we are bound to the sound
The groove and the mood is on replay another day
Ready to dance with me (Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !)
Let's get it out and be free (Who ! Who ! Who !)
Before you change your mind, please tonight'll be alright
'Cuz the light will be bright like a new day

Don't you stay and hold on to the past,
you go your way (forget all the things I said)
Now run away, just let it go, don't look back,
(keep going till you lose the memories)
I've gotta say, you've been a special man an easy game to play
Don't run away'cuz now I know,
you are just another fish in the ocean

Get up and dance look around it's paradise
Hit the floor and baby rock your body, mind, and soul on to the beat
Spin around we are bound to the sound
The groove and the mood is on replay another day
Ready to dance with me (Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !)
Let's get it out and be free (Who ! Who ! Who !)
Before you change your mind, please tonight'll be alright
'Cuz the light will be bright like a new day

Get up and dance look around it's paradise
Hit the floor and baby rock your body, mind, and soul on to the beat
Spin around we are bound to the sound
The groove and the mood is on replay another day
Ready to dance with me (Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !)
Let's get it out and be free (Who ! Who ! Who !)
Before you change your mind, please tonight'll be alright

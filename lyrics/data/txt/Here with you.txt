Nothing comes easy
Oh, but in my heart I know
Nothing can be lonelier
Than bein' far from home
Gazin' at the moonlight
And your eyes shine with tears
Are you feelin' sad tonight
Don't worry, I am here

Here where we belong
A million, million miles from home
Where stars we wish upon
And dreams are brave and new
You are here
And I'm here
Here with you

So I will give my heart to you
If you give your heart to me
You will be my only one
For all eternity
Sometimes in the moonlight
When I wake cold with fear
When I need you to hold me tight
Oh promise you'll be near

Here where we belong
A million, million miles from home
Where stars we wish upon
And dreams are brave and new
You are here
And I'm here
Here with you

Nothing comes easy
Oh, but in my heart I know
Nothing can be lonelier
Than bein' far from home
Yesterday is over
And tomorrow yet to come
Got a feelin' we'll be all right
Together we are home

Here where we belong
A million, million miles from home
Where stars we wish upon
And dreams are brave and new
You are here
And I'm here
Here with you

Here where we belong
A million, million miles from home
Here where we belong
Here where we belong

The day I found you in the end
The sky was so blue
Your smile was really sweet to me
I never forget

Even if I lose my way, I'll never give in
I'll find the way leads to you someday
I wanna believe

Tears and clouds, you may throw in the sky
Falling stars, you may hold in your dream
Show me how to light during the day
Smile for life, always I wanna see

Night and day, all day, today
I wanna sing, I wanna sleep, together
Always cheer me up

Even if you lose your way, you'll never give in
I'll find your way leads to your dream
So never mind

Tears and clouds, you may throw in the sky
Falling stars, you may hold in your dream
Show me how to light during the day
Smile for life, always I wanna see

Tears and clouds, you may throw in the sky
Falling stars, you may hold in your dream
Show me how to light during the day
Smile for life, always I wanna see

Night and day, all day, today
I wanna sing, I wanna sleep, together
Always cheer me up

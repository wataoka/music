Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kale i do scope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds. ah ah

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Every one smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so in credibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds. ah ah

Picture your self on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Sud denly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kale i do scope eyes.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds. ah ah

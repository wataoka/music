Show me the way
Now moving step by step to the shine lights
I wanna see the scenery reflecting your eyes

Why do I think, I think of you?
I wonder Why am I cry?
Closer I get to you, baby you
Woe,I want to gaze at all of you

Let's take a dream yes together
Everytime forever
Let's make a smile yes together
Everytime support you
I'm believing you
So you please don't lose your shine heart
When we'll work it out
Maybe I'll find it's truly love

Show me the love. I don't know that
Still I don't know that
But, feeling you inside of me. Yes, It's a miracle

An honest boy, You're Naughty boy
Sometime,I worry about you
But, We've only just begun to live
Maybe, We can change and find the way

Let's take a dream yes together
Everytime forever
Let's make a smile yes together
Everytime support you
I'm believing you
So you please don't lose your shine heart
When we'll work it out
Maybe I'll find it's truly love

Let's tale a dream yes together
Everytime forever
Let's make a smile yes together
Everytime support you
I'm believing you
So you please don't lose your shine heart
When we'll work it out
Maybe I'll find it's truly love

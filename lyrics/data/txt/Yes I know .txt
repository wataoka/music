Yes I know.
Close relation of danger and fire.
Hopefully not, I am weaker than that fire.

Come and join us.
Let's make our loop hand in hand.
It is contagious what we imagine and have fears.

Dazzling love, that what I want.
Empty life, please someone save my soul.

Dazzling love, that what I want.
Empty life, please someone save my soul.

Wherever you are, I feel you are by my side.
Whoever you are, it is fate that we met.

Yes I could.
Jump over the burning fire.
Suddenly, something appears inside of my body.

Don't be afraid to lose your way.
Only the time will ease our pain or not.

Don't be afraid to lose your way.
Only the time will ease our pain or not.

I can't go back to who I was.
But, I don't know why, but I go onâ€¦

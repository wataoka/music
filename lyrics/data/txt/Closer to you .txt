It's always on a Friday night, when everybody seems to go outside.
Why am I alone tonight?
I think I'll take my chances watching the city lights.
Somebody's calling me, I go up to my window, rushing but no sign.
I couldn't reply, cause I'm so shy.

But oh! I really want to go,
I really want to show myself that I can take these chances.
I just want to be the guy, who gets to be closer to you.
But oh! I'll maybe never know, it's not a T.V.show,
I'll never get a happy ending.
I don't want to say goodbye, I need to be...
Closer to you,
the way you look tonight gets me to ignite my heart for you.
It may be denial, it's all worth the while.
And all I want to do is be closer to you.
I'm running out of time. I never take the chances that I'm dealt.
Ooh whoo ho ho' ooh whoo oh oh!

You know I run to you,
but you don't even welcome me in your arms.
I'm just a little bit confused.
Seems like we were having a good afternoon.
Nobody's calling me, I go up in my bedroom. I'll sit down and sign.
I am ready to cry, why not cry?

But oh! I really want to go,
I really want to show myself that I can take these chances.
I just want to be the guy, who gets to be closer to you.
But oh! I'll maybe never know, it's not a T.V.show,
I'll never get a happy ending.
I don't want to say goodbye, I need to be...
Closer to you,
the way you look tonight gets me to ignite my heart for you.
It may be denial, it's all worth the while.
And all I want to do is be closer to you.
I'm running out of time. I never take the chances that I'm dealt.
Ooh whoo ho ho' ooh whoo oh oh!

another minute
feelin' so fine
you turn the freeze
into warm light

had a premonition
I been waitin' ever since
my world comin' down
it's got me spinnin' 'round

no guarantees
but I'm so sure
she's into silence
candy for the head

had a waking vision
I been so high ever since
my world comin' down
it's got me spinnin' 'round 

if you really wanna fly
you gotta let go

simply the most
big sensation
（once you're here you won't go back）
she's really pretty
One-eyed vision
（lose the fear it don't come back）
little sister showed me
really took me for a ride
my world comin' down
it got me spinnin' 'round
yeah, when I found you
my world came crashin' down

once you're here you won't go back
lose the fear it don't come back

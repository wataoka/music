Sorry that I'm such a mess
And I'm not wearing a pretty dress
I think I look pretty good to me
And sorry I haven't washed my hair
I'm sorry but maybe I don't care
Looking dirty's pretty cute to me

'Cause nothing's worth it, no one's perfect
Don't let anything get in the way
'Cause I don't wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the tv shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be anybody else but me

Sorry for saying what's on my mind
Instead of saying the proper lines
Holding back is impossible for me
Maybe we shouldn't try at all
Sometimes perfection is a flaw
It's really not my personality

'Cause nothing's worth it no one's perfect
Don't let anything get in the way
I don't wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the tv shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be anybody else but me

What happened to keeping it real
Being honest with the way you feel
Speak your mind and try to be yourself

I don't wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the tv shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be I don't really really wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the tv shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be anybody else but me

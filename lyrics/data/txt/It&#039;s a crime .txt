Boy you're so fine
You're on my mind
Like all of the time

I can't deny
I'm kind of sky
You're freakin me out

When you walk on by I'm tongue tied
Boy It's a crime you're not mine

And everytime you look in my eye
I'm just about to say my line
Something cool but it slips my mind

And everytime you look in my eye
I wish I had the nerve to say--hey
What's your name, can we hang-Boy,
It's a crime you're not mine

Boy you're so fly
I don't know why
I'm acting this way

Cause no other guy
Has got your shine
You give me the shakes

And you're giving me butterflies
Boy It's a crime you're not mine

And everytime you look in my eye
I'm just about to say my line
Something cool but it slips my mind

And everytime you look in my eye
I wish I had the nerve to say--hey
What's your name, can we hang-Boy,
It's a crime you're not mine

You give me butterflies
You're on my mind like all the time
You got me tongue tied
It's a crime that you're not mine

You're give me butterflies
You're on my mind like all the time
You got me tongue tied
Boy I'm gonna make you mine

And everytime you look in my eye
I'm just about to say my line
Something cool but it slips my mind

And everytime you look in my eye
I wish I had the nerve to say--hey
What's your name, can we hang-Boy,
It's a crime you're not mine

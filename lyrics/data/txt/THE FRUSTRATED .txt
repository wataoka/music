X-RATED/HIT THE HEAVEN/3 CHORDS/PLAY THE MUSIC/
4 BEATS/BACK TO BASIC/5 SENSE/AROUND THE WORLD/
LOOKING FOR THE REAL ENEMIES/X-RATED/
GIVE ME A REASON/WHY?/YOU ATTACK THE SYMBOLS/
WHY?/YOU'VE LOST HISTORY/
NOBODY CAN SAVE A TWISTED SOUL/
YOU SENT A LETTER TO THE WRONG ADDRESS/
FRUSTRATED/FRUSTRATED/I WILL GO/I WILL FIGHT/
I WILL DO, ROCK N' ROLL

BALLADはいつか深い眠りを誘う
飛ぶ夢はもう見ない
光を奪われた双頭の月の下で…

GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 踊り狂おう蝶のように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 甘い時間を二人で
BABY... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 揺れるカクテルグラスのように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...
WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...

夜中妖艶に輝く 魅惑のドレスまっとって la la la
男共を誘う香り振りまいて 流れる TUNE 乗って羽ばたく
君にやられた俺はたまらず 闇の中かき分け君を探す
かすかに見えるその背中に 今宵の全てを捧ぐ

GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 踊り狂おう蝶のように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 甘い時間を二人で
BABY... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 揺れるカクテルグラスのように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...
WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...

何気ない会話 自然と触れ合う心と身体
もう君以外は映らないミラーボールの真下
でそっと手を握るフロア 大丈夫さ誰もしないよ邪魔は
ストロボが君を照らす度 高鳴る鼓動

GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 踊り狂おう蝶のように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 甘い時間を二人で
BABY... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 揺れるカクテルグラスのように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...
WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...

CLUB 飛び出し 月明かり浴びて歩くネオン街へ
ほろ酔いの君の肩を抱いて誘う COME WITH IT BABY
二人さらけ出した何もかも 今宵で終わりかも
それでも交わる関係 沈むシーツの海の中で

GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 踊り狂おう蝶のように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 甘い時間を二人で
BABY... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 揺れるカクテルグラスのように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...
WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...

GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 踊り狂おう蝶のように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 甘い時間を二人で
BABY... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... 揺れるカクテルグラスのように
GAL... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...
WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME... WINE FOR ME...

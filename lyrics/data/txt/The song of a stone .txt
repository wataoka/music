I am singing from a far
I am calling out your name
Every leaf upon each branch sings my song
Let my mountains reach out arms
Let my rivers warp around
And lead you all my children,
Home to this Great Stone

I am the seed that quietly grows
Like a fire inside your bones
I am a vision planted there in your eyes
I am a flower that opens wide
To vast crystal caves inside
That lead you on and on
To where you all belong

I am the first small cry of birth
I am green shoot through the earth
Every bird with every breath sings my song
Let my seas wave out to you
through the fields of brilliant blue
To lead you all,my children
Home to this Great Stone

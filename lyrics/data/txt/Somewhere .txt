Somewhere in the world
Somewhere in the dark
I can hear the voice that calls my name
Might be a memory
Might be my future
Might be a love waiting for me

Rock me gently
Hug me tenderly
'Til the morning breaks, night fades away
I've spent my time in vain
Trapped inside pain
Don't let me down
Help me see the light

Feeling bitter and twisted all along
Wading through an empty life too long
I close my eyes
Listen to the wind
Longing to belong to a higher place

Let me hear your voice 
Let me be with you
When the shadow falls down upon me
Like a bird singing
Like a breeze blowing
It's calling me
Somewhere in the world

Feeling bitter and twisted all along
Wading through an empty life too long
I close my eyes
Listen to the wind
Longing to belong to a higher place

Let me hear your voice 
Let me be with you
When the shadow falls down upon me
Like a bird singing
Like a breeze blowing
It's calling me
Somewhere in the world

Somewhere in the world...

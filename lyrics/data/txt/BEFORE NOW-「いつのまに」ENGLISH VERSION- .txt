I'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THE SUNLIGHT
THAT THEY PROMISED ME
THOSE PUDDLES AND GREY SKIES
ARE ALL THAT I SEE

I'VE BEEN WISHING FOR THE END OF MY RAINBOW
THAT THEY GUARANTEED
BUT IT'S TROUBLES AND RAIN CLOUDS
HANG OVER ME

NOW IT ALL SEEMS SO FUNNY
EVEN MY TEARS HAVE JUST STOPPED TRYING
NOW LOOKING BACK ON IT
I WAS BORN INTO THIS LIFE CRYING

I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF ALL THE DOUBTS
THAT I'VE PILED UP DEEP INSIDE MY HEART
I FEEL NOTHING BUT WEIGHED DOWN
CHAINED TO THE GROUND

NOW IT ALL SEEMS SO FUNNY
EVEN MY TEARS HAVE JUST STOPPED TRYING
NOW LOOKING BACK ON IT
I WAS BORN INTO THIS LIFE CRYING

SAY YOU'LL PROMISE ME
THERE'S GONNA BE SUNLIGHT
TO DRY ALL THE RAIN

NOW IT ALL SEEMS SO FUNNY
EVEN MY TEARS HAVE JUST STOPPED TRYING
NOW LOOKING BACK ON IT
I WAS BORN INTO THIS LIFE CRYING

NOW IT ALL SEEMS SO FUNNY
EVEN MY TEARS HAVE JUST STOPPED TRYING
NOW LOOKING BACK ON IT
WE WERE BORN INTO THIS LIFE CRYING

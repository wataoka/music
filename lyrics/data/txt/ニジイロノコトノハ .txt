I always want to be in your heart
Even if you hate me,  I'm proud of you
A cloudy sky hangin' over us now
Can you recognize my voice when you hear it again

Why did you come and love me?
Why should I love you forever more
And as I wonder where you are
I just went behind the moon to sing your song and cry

Every word you say
makes me laugh and cry
So I keep callin' you
I believe my true feeling will reach you someday

Coz' you're destined to be with me, I know
It's true

風が伝えた 『言の葉』を憎んだ
黒く膨らんだ太陽 痛くて涙がこぼれた
しがみついた悪夢 恐れずにいたいと
このドアを開けたら 全てが見えてしまう

『呼ぶ声』は 遠く響く
やがて君が その手で包むと祈ろう
虹色に光る 言の葉

Every word you say
makes me laugh and cry
So I keep callin' you
I believe my true feeling will reach you someday

『呼ぶ声』は 遠く響く
やがて君が その手で包むと祈ろう
虹色に光る 言の葉

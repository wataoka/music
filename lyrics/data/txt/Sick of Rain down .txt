Everything is swallowed up into the clouded sky
As if praising the works of the evil power
Where our souls came from and are heading to?
Where our souls came from and are heading to?

There is no other ways to amend
For the biggest sins of the past century
Where our souls came from and are heading to?
Where our souls came from and are heading to?

Rain down
The dried earth with everlasting darkness
Keeps our minds shut
Rain down
In this moment,tender thoughts won't save the dying
Rain/

Fulfill souls seeking for Oasis,with that black button?
Mind and body,out of control
What's so beautiful,What's are we so sad about?
What's so beautiful,What's are we so sad about?

Rain down
We've lost the bread of life
But don't bow to them in mind
What can we do
Rain down
Are we giving up on a mother holding a dying baby?
Rain down
The dried earth with everlasting darkness
Keeps our minds shut
Rain down
In this moment,tender thoughts won't save the dying
Rain/

We hide and hate what kind of fate will greet our self-obsession?

My dear,my love,my yet unknown friends
Open minds and open hearts break down all borders

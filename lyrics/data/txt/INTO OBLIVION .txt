It's all so disposable
Take a look at the charts
And you will see

So sick and twisted
They only listen to it
Just to fit in

※Disconnect, connect
Disconnect, connect
Disconnect, connect※

My stick to your hole

How did it all ever end the funk up like this?

Another song has gone to waste
Into oblivion
Another tasteless punk is trying to judge me

I won't take this
No freedom, no freedom of speech

(※くり返し)

My stick to your hole

How did it all ever end the funk up like this?

My stick to your hole

Go away
Go away

Don't tell me what to make

My stick to your hole

How did it all ever end the funk up like this?

スピード上げる車にゆられ
街のまぶしい光が 遠くなっても

You don't need to say good bye いつまででも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも
You don't need to say good bye 卒業でも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも

ラジオさえ 何を言ってるのか
右から左へと 通り過ぎる

Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone
Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone

どうして 突然 呼び出したの
微笑み忘れたくちびるで
悲しいことなら 言わないで
あなたの言葉を待っている
1秒さえ 胸がつまる 夜が痛い Oh…

You don't need to say good bye いつまででも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも
You don't need to say good bye 卒業でも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも

Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone
Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone

車途絶えた 夜のブリッジ
はるか眺めたビル街 ただふたりきり

You don't need to say good bye いつまででも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも
You don't need to say good bye 卒業でも
You don't need to say good bye

どうして 突然 黙り込むの
淋しくするなら最初から
優しいままなら最後まで
変わらず私をみつめてて
声にならず 心の中 祈っている Oh…

You don't need to say good bye いつまででも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも

Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone
Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone

You don't need to say good bye 卒業でも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも
You don't need to say good bye いつまででも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも

Tell me why you still feel loneliness
Tell me why you are still alone

You don't need to say good bye いつまででも
You don't need to say good bye このままでも
You don't need to say good bye
You don't need to say good bye

I've been eating an apple a day
that's what my mum wants me to do
even though I did it, I still got a cold
whatever I've done and I'm still doing

An apple a day

I was eating an apple on the day
that day I lost you forever
it was too fine day to lose something
whatever I cried a bit and smiled

An apple a day

that's what only I can do
in a world that is missing you

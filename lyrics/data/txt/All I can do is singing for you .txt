I hear the birds hamming in the dream
It is like a kiss, my mom used to do
I feel a gentle breeze
I see the true tears with the smile
That's all there is...

Thank you for all my friends around me
And I'm thankful for all beside you
If your treasure is fine, it's my pleasure
I don't forget it on the globe

When the numerous stars shine on me
I don't know why sometimes I just feel all alone
The shining rays show to me
It leads to me the way to go

Love is Song and so Love is brightness
Hold on us
Please listen to my heartbeat
World is one and so World is wonderful
Hand in globe, forever

I wish for you
All I can do is singing for you

I hear the baby's crying from faraway
It is like words, as if fairy say
I feel a whisper voice
But it's a strong force with a dream
That's all there is...

The flower knows beautiful as small one
And you're only one so, you are beautiful
Oh, we breath in the air
Our life is fair
Sometimes we are lost on the road

Today the sun rises again
I don't know why sometimes I just feel not alone
But rainy day I sing for love
Because the raindrops talk to me

Love is growth and so Love is sweetness
Call on me
Please open your eyes I'm here
Life is wave and so Life is tenderness
Like a sea
Like a bird

Can you remind?
All I can do is singing for you

When I walk hand in hand with you
I don't know why always I find happiness
The shining days show to me
There is the rainbow in the sky

Love is Song and so Love is brightness
Hold on us
Please listen to my heartbeat
World is one and so World is wonderful
Hand in globe, forever

I wish for you
All I can do is singing for you

The world is a battlefield
We're in a dark shadow
You win or you'll be lost forever
Don't waste all your tears
Reality is so hollow
You gotta fight, be a survivor

No way I'll be the sacrifice
No matter what they bellow
I win not give in to their hunger
We all die alone
I find it hard to swallow
I need you here, keep me alive

In heaven whenever I see you
I drop all my weapons
You tell me the meaning to life
How you drive me mad

INSANE, MY PAIN, I'm screaming on the inside
Awake to the justice
AGAIN, IN VAIN, I'm reaching for an answer
My tragedy just fades away
I dedicate it all to you

No one will last in disguise
Time flies like an arrow
Under your halo, I'll surrender

In heaven whenever I feel you
I unload my handgun
You give me the will to go on
Do I drive you mad

INSANE,MY PAIN, I'm rushing to the outside
Now over the distance
I PRAY, IN RAIN, You're tearing off the cancer
My destiny will break away
I wanna make it up to you

INSANE, MY PAIN, I'm screaming on the inside
Awake to the justice
AGAIN, IN VAIN, I'm reaching for an answer
My tragedy just fades away
I dedicate it all...

INSANE, MY PAIN, I'm rushing to the outside
Now over the distance
I PRAY, IN RAIN, You're tearing off the cancer
My destiny will break away
Cuz I wanna make it up to you

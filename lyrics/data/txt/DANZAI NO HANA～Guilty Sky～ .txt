Hear my heart, wandering in side your mind
I still can't let you go
Feel my hand, reaching out for you
there's nowhere I can rest my soul
Yet again, somebody is crying all alone
lost in the night
A trick is played, fate is what we can't avoid
but now we have to move on

Still I cherish what you gave to me
nothing can take it's place
Do you know how trapped
I am, don't leave me here alone

Beautiful, the flowers bloom
her grace will never die
Nothing can shake her mind,
she'll keep her face towards the blazing light
Clouds that break away today
share my pain oh guilty sky
Deep down inside I cried for my soul
emhraced the tears that flows

Don't you know, there is a beginning
in every single pain
Anxiously waiting for the end
to come for it to fade away
Now your warmth, all of that is vague for me to touch
your love is faint
No color there, can you see my hand
it used to reach out for you every day

Silence catches up on me,
there's no longer a place for me
Now I've reached my destiny
I'm walking for myself

Beautiful, the flowers bloom
her grace will never die
Nothing can shake her mind,
she'll keep her face towards the blazing light
Clouds that break away today
share my pain oh guilty sky
Deep down inside I cried for my soul
embraced the tears that flows

This world I am standing on
Needed some solitude
That truth I had to accept, soak it in
Your shadow I can see
Your dream I can't aweke
I tried to trece it all

Still I cherish what you gave to me
nothing can take it's place
Do you know how trapped
I am, don't leave me here alone

Beautiful, the flowers bloom
her grace will never die
Nothing can shake her mind,
she'll keep her face towards the blazing light
Clouds that break away today
share my pain oh guilty sky
Deep down inside I cried for my soul
embraced the tears that flows

Seeking for the future, yeah
I'll keep on dancing towards my shining days

When we met the pain stood still
It was us

Then suddenly it's where'd you go?
The system blew I knew

This side of me I want a little more
But inside it seems I'm just a little boy
Nothing else

Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down
Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up

嘘を一つ 愛を二つ
それでなんとかやり過ごしてきたでしょ?
でもそれじゃもう僕をダマせないでしょ?
じゃどうする?どうしよ!

Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
描きたがりな未来に明日はない
いっそどうせ痛むなら傷め続けよう

Get up Get up Get up Get up
Time to make amends for what you did
Get up Get up Get up Get up
Running with the demons in your head
Let's shout it out completely
You never really wanna know
Let's shout it out were screaming oh oh

Don't go it's a might long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down
Don't go it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up

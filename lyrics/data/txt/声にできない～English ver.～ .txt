I know I've felt this way before
Should've known cause I'm for sure
This story's at its end
Cause I'm right back here again

We have gone our different ways
Turned our back on yesterday
And the morning sun will rise
Here without you by my side

I still can feel your hand in mine
The memory deep inside
Even with you far away
Before my eyes an empty sky
Is all that I can see

Don't know why love can be so hard
Every day goes by, here without you in my arms
Can't deny what I feel but I can't seem to fine
Any better words than just
“I'm missing U”

Such a fool to be so blind
After all is lost to find
How much it really meant
To have you here by my side

I still can see you're in my mind
That sweet and tender smile
Even with you far away
I close my eyes in hope to find
You there, waiting for me

Tell me why, why our love has gone
Every breath I take, here without you in my arms
Can't deny what I fell but I can't seem to fine
Any better words that just
“I'm missing U”

Under the stars I whisper wishes to the wind
Wish that I could've changed
All the wrongs that I've made

Don't know why love can be so hard
Every day goes by, here without you in my arms
Can't deny what I feel but I can't seem to fine
Any better words than just
“I'm missing U”

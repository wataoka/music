I had a bad day like I've never ever had
So I made a quick call to the devil in my lamp
And he wants me to be this way
And he wants me to be that way
Oh my lordy!

Bad boy invites you to be yellow

Gotta stop me moving but I just can't stop
Ticking and a clicking like a broken clock
Our time is your time
Get on the dance floor

Fat boy (dance mutherfucker)
He's shaking it to the beat (C'mon c'mon, c'mon yeah)

Surfing on (a lemon)
All your brainwaves
Sun in skin
Dry your everything

So sweet
Let the taste surround you now
Join me
And we can come together now
All we all need :loving, loving

Sometimes I need a new degree
One time I saw a helium
Hard time candy swallowing
No time to ever get too
Lonely, lonely
Call me, call me

Bite it
It's all that you need to know
Drive it
It's somewhere you need to go

Man on moon (a lemon)
I'm just floating here for you
Clear blue skies (a lemon)
Mixed with ocean blue

So sweet
Let the taste surround you now
Join me
We can come together
All we all need :loving, loving

Sometimes I need a new degree
One time I saw a helium
Hard time candy swallowing
This time I'm taking everything
Slowly, slowly
Hold me closely

If you ever need to feel it
Just sing the lemontune
It could be the sweetest flavor
If you open up your head
If you need someone to take you
Just call me out again
And I know life's not that easy
But it doesn't have to be hard
When all that's left is the moment
We'll make the moment ours
If it becomes time to be going
Just take the feeling home
And then we'll come back again tomorrow

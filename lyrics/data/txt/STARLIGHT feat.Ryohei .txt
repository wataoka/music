1/2 past 1, Now it's gettin HOT in HERE
3,2,1, There are so many GIRLS in HERE, ALONE

Bartender, Fix ONE, SO my mind CAN BLOW
Surrender, Now we'll let the MUSIC FLOW, HOLD ON

SMOKE in my EYES, 眼が眩らんだ
煙混じりに飛び込む
人ごみの中こそI C U
YOU ARE MY STARLIGHT

SO Can you DANCE with ME
Can you ROCK with ME
Can you MOVE your BODY
Can you get HIGH with ME
Can you FLY with ME
Can you FEEL the ECSTACY
SO Can you DANCE with ME
Can you ROCK with ME
Can you MOVE your BODY
Can you get HIGH with ME
Can you FLY with ME
Can you FEEL the ECSTACY

BRING it UP, I CAN only hear the TICKS
BURN it UP, SELECT something EROTIC, COME ON

Come CLOSER, Feel her LIPS behind my EARS
Don't Rush HER, Now she's taken off her FEARS, GO ON

LOVE is SO BRIGHT, 眼が眩らんだ
明かりの中はHARD TO FIND
暗闇だからこそI C U
YOU ARE MY STARLIGHT

SMOKE in my EYES, 眼が眩らんだ
煙混じりに飛び込む
人ごみの中こそI C U
YOU ARE MY STARLIGHT

SO Can you DANCE with ME
Can you ROCK with ME
Can you MOVE your BODY
Can you get HIGH with ME
Can you FLY with ME
Can you FEEL the ECSTACY
SO Can you DANCE with ME
Can you ROCK with ME
Can you MOVE your BODY
Can you get HIGH with ME
Can you FLY with ME
Can you FEEL the ECSTACY

SMOKE in my EYES, 眼が眩らんだ
煙混じりに飛び込む
人ごみの中こそI C U
YOU ARE MY STARLIGHT

The possibility that I make a mistake
You go mad in this strong possibility
My word and deed
It has been input into your brain
After malfunction
Inevitable bugs

Discomfort of the waking
And dizziness
The possibility that I make a mistake
Predictable...
2 minutes later…
After malfunction
Inevitable bugs

You are my[instability]
I'm your enormous virus
Sometimes freeze without mixing
Repeated contact damage

But...There is not the hatred here
Flip side of affection
Gentle deadfall
All is honeytrap

Now, dive into the hill of repose

The scenery which you wish for
In the other side of this dream
To the world where nobody is
Falling while embraced you
Deeply

偽り無きその無邪気さに
汚れ無き詩を送ろう
その傷を飲み込むように
さぁ目を開いてご覧
孤独の価値が咲いている

You are my[instability]
I'm your enormous virus
Sometimes freeze without mixing
Repeated contact damage

But...There is not the hatred here
Flip side of affection
Gentle deadfall
All is honeytrap

[Instability]that you gave

Because you are always here, I can advance before

The scenery which you wish for
In the other side of this dream
To the world where nobody is
Falling while embraced you
Deeply

To the world where nobody is…
Falling while embraced you
Deeply
Because you are always here, I can advance before

Let's Dive

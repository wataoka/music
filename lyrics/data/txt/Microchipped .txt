"Enemies are here to seize you!"
This the cry of the serpent liars
'91 they introduced it
2012 come the new world order

Mold you up and clone you up
Spread the fear on the silent sheep yeah
Don't be stalling, keep it rolling
Move your feet to the army grind yeah

I can't hear you(Not allowed to)
I can't feel you(Although I've wanted to)
I can't speak through what I am saying

But I see, but I see
It's all I can do
It's all that I can do
And I see, and I see
It's all I can do
And all the things I sense from you
Yeah I see, yeah I see

Don't you see? They're trying to breed you
Think you're free, but they've got you bound
Vulnerable and mind controlled
You're enslaved, just the way they want you

I can't hear you(Not allowed to)
I can't feel you(Although I've wanted to)
I can't speak through what I am saying

But I see, but I see
It's all I can do
It's all that I can do
And I see, and I see
It's all I can do
And all the things I sense from you
Yeah I see, yeah I see

It's all because of how the sector made me
It's all because of how they tried to break me

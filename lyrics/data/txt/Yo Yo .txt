That girl is a yoyo
Giving me “go, go”
Then she's like “no, no”.
I don't know why she got me riding so high And flying so low.
That girl is a yoyo.

She got my heart beating double time
With that thing she do.
Oh and she plays me every time
With that thing she do.

She keeps me guessing
And she leads me on.
I don't need to question 'cause I know...

The club is jumping all night long
But she's the only one I see.
We're moving closer
I'm all up on her...
I turn around, she's gone.

She keeps me guessing
But I'm holding on.
I don't need to question 'cause I know...

Oh my god I'm fucked up
Let me go but I can't go
Cause she is the one that who I needed
Never had a feeling off doubt about the love
And a love gets stronger and bigger then ever
But she's still tease me everyday
And I can't handle anymore

One gift I received on the day that I came to life
Do I not know how can I ignore what I was meant to become

One goal I pursue all the way till I find it clear
Through a storm, there'll be the sunlight on the road to grand slam

Take a chance that’s the only way
People may all say, "It's just a fancy dream."
No one can get on my way

To see what is for sure
To touch what is for real
To reach what is for good
That's how I face my destination

One fate I must accept was to pay to make a legend
Through the night, and there’ll be dawning on the road to grand slam

Make a vow and devote my days
Let the people say, "He is so ambitious."
Go ahead and make my day

To see what is for sure
To touch what is for real
To reach what is for good
That's how I face my destination

To find what is for sure
What a grace to get me going
To feel the life so real
That's the road to bring me higher

To see what is for sure
To touch what is for real
To reach what is for good
That's how I face my destination

To find what is for sure
What a grace to get me going
To feel the life so real
That's the road to bring me higher

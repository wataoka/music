If I feel the urge
You needn't say a word‘cause

Just like that
I would stay here

Just like that
Spend my time here

Just like that
Take a break for days

Just like that
I could live here

Just like that
Move my life here

Just like that
I would find a way to stay

Just like that
I would find a way to stay

I made myself one promise
Said I'd just stay one moment
I tried so hard to listen
Things change
I'm not leaving

My heart won't know any better
My mood changes fast like the weather
Now I don't know if I'll ever
Go back
So whatever

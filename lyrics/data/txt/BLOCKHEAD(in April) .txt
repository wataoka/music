They wouldn't need my song at such time.
Because everyone likes popular song.
If going to that town,
I don't need a guitar.

Deep fear and the heavy heavy grief,
The coldness, hunger
and sickness,
If going to that town,
I don't need a guitar.

I also sing today.
That's for myself as before.
I'm still a blockhead.
I'm not useful.

It's the people who are also
nameless that the money was paid.
But that's in that celebrity's status!

Everyone holds contradiction.
But I'm not the person made vague.
That rock star who
blames a power company!

I also sing today.
That's for myself as before.
I'm still a blockhead.
I'm not useful.

My friend has fulfilled a lifework.
That's when his father died.
Didn't you know?
Our life is such one.

I also sing today.
That's for myself as before.
I'm still a blockhead.
I'm not useful.

You are my possession
Cannot let go
Sorry but, its all controlled
I'm your possession
Right now, up 'till forever
Don't you feel the passion burning hot inside you?

You are my possession
I take you higher
Sooth and luscious nights together
I'm your possession
Your touch, caress and whispers
Make me wanna give to you my body and soul

You are mine and I'm yours
Our love don't mean much more
But is there more that can be asked for?
I watch over you through day and dark nights
You're roaming in my mind, so
Aren't you owned?

What you do I do too
Isn't that strange, my boo?
Laughing don't even seem right without you
I feel this love is gives me melody
And I feel harmony
Oh I'm totally yours

I'm sinking deep and fast in to you
Everything 'round me just seems so new
I may be weak and too young to play games
No reason to stop, I'm devoured by your daze

â€»

Quite submissive that's me, overprotective you
Pull me around and I'll listen to you
Even in fights, we make love oh so fine
That brings us to delight
We're lovers, we adore

Your lust keeps my heart beating
Everything 'round me seems so exciting
You cry my tears and I feel you sore and pains
This is the love, everyone longs for

You are my possession
I take you higher
Sooth and luscious nights together
I'm your possession
Your touch, caress and whispers
Make me wanna give to you my body and soul

Being loved its made me realize
How precious love can make your whole life shine
Impossible to live without you
You've given me too much to leave

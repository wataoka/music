I know that you
You've done so much
It's kinda hard to do it over
Thinkin' about nothing but work will make you sad
So I'll make you smile, yeah
Show me what you've got baby
Just tell me what you want baby
I will be the man tonight
(for you)

Show me what you've got baby
Just tell me what you want baby
You will be the queen tonight
(all night long)

Never stop until the end of time
You better feel the vibe I make for you, don't care the time
Don't ever stop just move your body right
All night long, so you'll be feeling oh, so right tonight

Just shake your booties
I will be singing for you
All day all night
Forget about your job
I will make you feel like you never know
You will be feeling like you're my girl
I wanna be your man

All I can do
Is just a few
but I promise you to make you feel good
Taking your time might be the thing you do for now
Then I'll take you high

Show me what you've got baby
Just tell me what you want baby
I will be the man tonight
(for you)

Show me what you've got baby
Just tell me what you want baby
You will be the queen tonight
(all night long)

Never stop until the end of time
You better feel the vibe I make for you, don't care the time
Don't ever stop just move your body right
All night long, so you'll be feeling oh, so right tonight

Just shake your booties
I will be singing for you
All day all night
Forget about your j・o・bs
I will make you feel like you never know
You will be feeling like you're my girl
I wanna be your man

Everything
That you do
Will be OK
Don't you be afraid
I will sing for you
relax your mind
Girl, anything is possible

Never stop until the end of time
You better feel the vibe I make for you, don't care the time
Don't ever stop just move your body right
All night long, so you'll be feeling oh, so right tonight
Just shake your booties
I will be singing for you
All day all night
Forget about your j・o・bs
I will make you feel like you never know
You will be feeling like you're my girl
I wanna be your man

All the world over, so easy to see
People everywhere just wanna be free
Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be
Peace in the valley, people got to be free

You should see, what a lovely, lovely world it would be
If everyone learned to live together, ah-hah-unh
Seems to me such an easy, easy thing this should be
Why can't you and me learn to love one another

All the world over, so easy to see
People everywhere just wanna be free
I can't understand it, so simple to me
People everywhere just got to be free
Ah, ah, yeah... ah, ah, yeah

If there's a man who is down and needs a helping hand
All it takes is you to understand and to see him through, ah-hah-unh
Seems to me, we got to solve it individually
And I'll do unto you what you do to me

There'll be shoutin' from the mountains on out to sea
No two ways about it, people got to be free
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
It's a natural situation for a man to be free

Oh, what a feelin's just come over me
Enough to move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody's dancing, come on, let's go see
Peace in the valley, now we ought to be free

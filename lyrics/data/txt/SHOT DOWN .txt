Hey little girl,
What's the matter with you?
Don't you like
The things I do?
You're wearing a frown
I've been shot down

Hey little girl,
I play a guitar
I even drive
A brand new car
Big man in town,
I've been shot down

WAAAHHHH
I thought he was having fun,
Now see what you've done
Can't show my face in town
Cause I've been shot down

Hey little girl,
I need you so
If you want my love,
Just let me know
Stop running around,
I've been shot down!

I went out for a walk last night
The stars were out and the moon was bright
And a little voice inside my head
It hit me hard this is what it said
Isn't it always love

That makes you hang your head
And isn't it always love that makes you cry
But isn't it always love
That takes the tears away
And you wouldn't have it any other away
When you find someone that's true to you
Well some days are rough
Oh some days are blue
But just don't go and throw it all away
Wait a minute, you gotta hear what I say
Isn't it always love

That makes you hang your head
And isn't it always love that makes you cry
But isn't it always love
That takes the tears away
And you wouldn't have it any other away
I used to think that love was just a loser's game
And I swore that I'd never play it and lose again
But now I know Now I see it
Isn't it always love

That makes you hang your head
And isn't it always love that makes you cry
But isn't it always love
That takes the tears away
And you wouldn't have it any other away
Isn't it always love

That makes you hang your head
And isn't it always love that makes you cry
But isn't it always love
That takes the tears away
And you wouldn't have it any other away
Isn't it always love

That makes you hang your head
And isn't it always love that makes you cry
But isn't it always love
That takes the tears away

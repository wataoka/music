Master of Codes

I rule on this throne
By anarchy
Of circuitry
This is the end of all you'll know

Seeds have been sown
Down Silicon Roads
By the kings of Control
Who now mutate
Your human shape
Till there's an end to all you'll know

O can we be
Absolutely free
Or Must we simulate every need?
are we just empty shells
In virtual hell?

O this, I'll resist
I will exist
Not be eclipsed
There'll be no end to all I'll know

I'll have to stand alone

Hello my baby!
What do you want?
We are standing here
Everyday, everybody eats the cake
We have not fuckin' rules throw away fuckin' meat
“There is a paradise!”
Sing a song

Hi! Love baby, drowsy eyes
We can't stop this time
Everyday, everybody eats the cake
Fifteen-0, I need your love, virginity love game
You are… The long hair & beauty girl!

Oh Mary, Oh Mary
You know I never try it again
Cause I don't have to return yesterday
Oh Mary, Oh Mary
Please don't cry again
But we don't like snow…
To love forever!

I'm better off alone
Everybody come and go
Moving fast, high-and high

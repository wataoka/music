Your voice Your smile touching my heart
Your beat Your warmth don't leave my heart
You're my treasure You're my pleasure

We go walking at night til the breaking of the day
Never know what's like a daytime relation
We go walking at night til the breaking of the day
Never know what's like a daytime relation

光と影 時に貴方 姿変える 愛のジキル
涙の雨 歓喜の太陽 使い分けて 惑わせる

Tell me your name どっちなの?
Tell me your thought 分からない
You make me crazy now 助けて

Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
You are my star Shape of my heart
Take off the ring Take off my clothes Dance with me now
Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
Rolling the dice Do what you want
My destiny's on your hands now don't you
Kiss me Kill me

We go walking at night til the breaking of the day
Never know what's like a daytime relation
We go walking at night til the breaking of the day
Never know what's like a daytime relation

朝と夜の 狭間に立ち 心染める 哀のハイド
時にキスを 時に傷を 飴と鞭で 狂わせる

Show me your face どっちでも
Show me your choice 従う
I can't live without you 手遅れ

Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
You are my star Shape of my heart
Take off the ring Take off my clothes Dance with me now
Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
Rolling the dice Do what you want
My destiny's on your hands now don't you
Kiss me Kill me

When does it ends No one knows that
But I don't care You're my everything
How can I change Who can change me No one can't do
Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
Rolling the dice Do what you want
My destiny's on your hands now don't you

Kiss me now
Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
You are my star Shape of my heart
Take off the ring Take off my clothes Dance with me now
Kiss me Kill me Love me Hate me
Rolling the dice Do what you want
My destiny's on your hands now don't you
Kiss me Kill me

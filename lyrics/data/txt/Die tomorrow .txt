Nothing lasts forever
So don't you ever take a thing for granted
Have you ever wondered?
What if we could all just die tomorrow

These situations are elevating
Where dreams are lost all hope is gone
We can't go on living like this
Manipulated by information
All right is wrong all wrong is right
We can't go on living like this

The people keep walking
On tracks that are made by fools who don't care
I don't know why we keep damaging ourselves

Nothing lasts forever
So don't you ever take a thing for granted
Have you ever wondered?
What if we could all just die tomorrow
When everything you see is a lie
All you have to do is close your eyes
Listen to the voice inside
Cause our hearts must stay alive

Our hearts must stay alive

All this time
We only try to find a way to hide it all away
All this time
We only try to find a way to runaway
Now everything must change

Its time now

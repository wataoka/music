He's always by her side He follows her around
He kisses her again
But there's someone else who needs him
All around the world She's a little girl
As he takes her by the hand
There's still someone else who needs him

Only because she can't say no, he clings on to her and won't let go
I hate to tell you, “I told you so”

Do you want to be her perfect friend ?
Do you want to move on from this game ?
Do you want to be her perfect friend ?
Only because she can't say no She can't say no

The love that you have found Is only a blindfold
I know that you had fun
But there's someone else who needs him

Only because she can't say no, he clings on to her and won't let go
I hate to tell you, “I told you so”

Then I noticed that the table's turned
It's not what she wanted in return
As he breaks up with the other girl
He is the one who can't say no
He can't say no He can't say no

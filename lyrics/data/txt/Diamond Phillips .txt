sick of my hurt and pain
sick of my truth and lie
sick of my love and hate
all my inside
sick of my doctor and drug
sick of my guitar and gun
sick of my angel and monster
all my outside

sick of my thinking and feeling
and sense and sensibility
sick of my sight and sound
sick of my light and shade
sick of my past and future
You don't matter

I follow you with diamonds in the eyes
I wonder why you wander around in the sky

I'm rolling, rolling in my soul.
I don't care, I don't care how you're gonna move.
It's crawling, crawling in the dark.
I wanna get myself away from me now.

Won't you tell me what you got?
Set me free
Won't you show me what you got now?
I'm givin up my hand for grace and glory

Let it roll, let it roll, like a rolling stone.
I got a feeling, feeling in your eyes.
Get it out, get it out, get it out of my head.
Can't rise from the bottoms. Time files when you got it.

Won't you tell me what you got?
Set me free
Won't you show me what you got now?
I'm givin up my hand for grace and glory

Won't you tell me what you got?
Set me free
Won't you show me what you got now?
I'm givin up my hand for grace and glory

I'd bleed for you.
Keep it through the night.
I'd steal for you.
I'd take, I'd take,yeah!!

Won't you tell me what you got?
Set me free
Won't you show me what you got now?
I'm givin up my hand for grace and glory

Won't you tell me what you got?
Set me free
Won't you show me what you got now?
I'm givin up my hand for grace and glory

Won't you tell me what you got?
Set me free
Won't you show me what you got now?
I'm givin up my hand for grace and glory

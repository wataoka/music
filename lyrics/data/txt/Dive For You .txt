I would dive for you
I would dive for you
Good times are
rollin'
Bad things are not
here
No one else compares
No one compares to
you
I would dive for you
I would dive for you
Good times are
rollin'
Bad things are not
here
No one else compares
No one compares to
you

I would dive for you
Feeling like
I'm hypnotized
Make me what I am
Make me who I be
Time of my life now
Time of my life now
man

I would dive for you
I would dive for you

See you next life
time
and Push me
I can be what you
want me to be girl
See you next life
time
and Push me
I can be what you
want me to be girl
See you next life
time
and Push me
I can be what you
want me to be girl
See you next life
time
See you next
life time and
See you next life
time
and Push me
I can be what you
want me to be girl
I can be what you
want me to be girl
I can be what you
want me to be girlâ€¦

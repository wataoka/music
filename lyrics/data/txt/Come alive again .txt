Came without warning like a streak of lightning
Sorrow and pain , We are put to the test now
No word can heal your wounds,Your desperation
No song will touch your heart, Soul deprivation
As I stand gazing all washed away
I feel so helpless and my heart is aching

(We're) Waiting for salvation
Come light our way
We shall come back to our lives
Rising again like a phoenix reborn
Give us the power to live
Under debris waits the nameless victims
Time has no mercy, precious memories shattered
You can't run away from God's creation
Tell me the price for pain and shiver

(We're) Waiting for salvation
Come light our way
We shall come back to our lives
Rising again like a phoenix reborn
Give us the power to live

Look up to the sky above and asking God for help
May God bless the all lost souls rest in peace

(We're) Waiting for salvation
Come light our way
We shall come back to our lives
Rising again like a phoenix reborn
Give us the power to live

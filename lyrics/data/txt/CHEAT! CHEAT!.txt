Well, I thought you were my steady guy
Till I saw you talkin'
Walken' by her side
And it hurts so bad, Oh now baby
When I think you're really not
The way you seem to be

'Cause when you smiled at her I know
She's your other love
And I'm another fool
Now I find myself goin' crazy
When I think of all we shared
And what you mean to be

Cheat! Cheat! I'm cryin', oh yeah
Don't you know I was true
Why'd you wanna go and make me blue
Cheat! Cheat! I'm cryin', oh yeah
Now I know we are throught
Why'd you wanna break my heart in two

Remember you said that you were mine
Swore that you would love me
Till the end of mine
Was it just a lie to decieve me
Oh but someday you'll be sorry
Baby wait and see

I hope that you find somebody who
Turns around and breaks
Your creatin' heart in two
Then you're gonna cry, boy, believe me
Wishin' everything could be
The way it used to be

Cheat! Cheat! I'm cryin', oh yeah
Don't you know I was true
Why'd you wanna go and make me blue
Cheat! Cheat! I'm cryin', oh yeah
Now I know we are throught
Why'd you wanna break my heart in two

Shame on you
You broke the rules
When you played around
But my friend
In the end
Cheaters never win

Cheat! Cheat! I'm cryin', oh yeah
Don't you know I was true
Why'd you wanna go and make me blue
Cheat! Cheat! I'm cryin', oh yeah
Now I know we are throught
Why'd you wanna break my heart in two

Why'd you wanna break my heart in two

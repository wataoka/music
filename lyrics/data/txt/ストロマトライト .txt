Standing in the middle of the night, tonight,
the air's getting dense with resolution.
Fading every phenomena out from the sight,
there's no use in hustling for revolution.

Anymore.

The world questions us what it's all about,
the sun's going down, we narrow our eyes.
Feeling all the emotion vanish from the sight,
as it turns to the heat then we close our eyes.

Anyone. We close our eyes.

All I really want to know is...

It's all been fated from the start?
I really don't think that it's the only way it should be.
Is it the light from longest past?
Or it's the future that goes away
beyond the time and space or more.

Silence & Violence.
Sadness & Madness.
Suspense & Loseness.

Success.

Whisper of my ghost.

I am a soul to fight,
I become a god who fights.
I am a soul to fight.
I become a god who fights.

My ghost becomes a god.
It's showtime.

My ghost begins fighting now.
My ghost begins to shout now.
My ghost begins fighting now.
My ghost begins to fly now.

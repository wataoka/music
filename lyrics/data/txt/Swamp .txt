I'm tired of trying
like carved my name on the wall
錆び付いた chain of chronic grief
さっきまでの偽善
on my cruising lane

hazy breathe
hazy view
hazy moon
in a lonely voice

lazy bones
lazy crush
lazy smile
in wonder

feel so lazy for some reason
erase

刻まれた about 4 meters
物憂げな vanished amid in the crowd
don't you know 暗いあの夜に
why you wanted to see 溢れた事態
can't fall in a rut

afraid of being
blamed for daring deed
made a negative blank statement
燃え尽きた灰の様な
消え去る記憶
on my cruising lane

hazy breathe
hazy view
hazy moon
in a lonely voice

lazy bones
lazy crush
lazy smile
in wonder

feel so lazy for some reason
erase

刻まれた about 4 meters
物憂げな vanished amid in the crowd
don't you know 暗いあの夜に
why you wanted to see 溢れた事態
can't fall in a rut

固く閉ざす扉開いて
and caught in lazy flash
just caught in hazy flash

嫌われたこの夜に
無機質な音が響く
don't you know
why you wanted to see
紛れてる光の群れ

vanished amid in the crowd
just 0 meter
物憂げな顔を捨てて
don't you know
why wanted to see me
今すぐに方を付けろ
can't fall in a rut

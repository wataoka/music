Baby Face
What's goin' on?
Seems you've given up
'Cause you look so down

Baby face
Is somethin' wrong?
You know your face is 'bout ten feet long
Just give a little sigh
You don't have to cry
It can't be so bad

Baby face
What's on your mind?
It looks to me you're wasting all your time
Come on

Baby face
Now here's a tip
You're gonna stumble on your own lip
Put it all away
Cause there's other days
Please don't look so sad

Smile and let it go
Jus' laugh and let sunshine take control and
Tell yourself a joke
And laugh some more

Smile and you will see
How easy and simple life can be now
You jus' have to try
Let yourself believe

Baby face
Here's what you do
Jus' sing yourself a little melody or two

Baby face
Yeah it's alright
you'll find your happiness is inside
Inside of you
Yeah yeah yeah you

You gotta try

Baby face
Yeah loose the frown
Jus' tell your mouth it's upside down
Just give a little sigh
You don't have to cry
No, please don't be sad

Smile and let it go
Jus' laugh and let sunshine take control and
Tell yourself a joke
And laugh some more

Smile and you will see
How easy and simple life can be now
You jus' have to try
Let yourself believe

Smile and let it go
Don't matter which way
the wind might blow cause
Everywhere's a chance
Waiting to grow

Jus' be who you are
Cause you could even charm the sparkle
from a star

Smile,
and the world will be laughin', now
Smile,
and the sun will be shinin', now
Smile,
and the whole world will smile for you

That's all you gotta do
That's all you gotta do

Baby face
Come on
Jus' smile for the world

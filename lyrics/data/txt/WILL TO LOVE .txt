There's nothing I really want
Nothing else that I need
If you're standing by my side
The dream I had yesterday

The world is gone, the end of time
If you're here, I won't be afraid
From a hole in the sky
Fiery tongue, the tip is dry
Trembling flowers fear for their lives, taken easily
In the morning, I could see the fields, and they were burning
Sea will rise against the careless man and it was weeping

There's nothing I really need
I won't be afraid of anything
I'm gonna hold you tight, In my arms,
I'll sing for you

I'm wondering where we're going to?
And wondering how far we'll go?
Will the sky be blue?
There's a hole within our hearts
Mended but then the bandage falls
And goes crashing down, crashing down, for everyone to hear
And tomorrow I will sow the seeds, hope is calling
In the forest, I can hear the rain, tears are falling

There's nothing I really need
I won't be afraid of anything
I'm gonna hold you tight, In my arms,
I'll sing for you

I pray, the will to live is blooming deep in our heartsâ€¦
Unharmed by chaos and screaming
I pray the will to love by our side will always be here

There's nothing I really need
I won't be afraid of anything
I'm gonna hold you tight, In my arms,
I'll sing for you

Even if I lost everything
It's only my heart that I can bring
I'm gonna hold you tight in my arms,
I will sing for you

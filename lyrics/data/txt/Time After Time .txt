Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback-warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say-go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look-and you will find
Me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you-I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows-you're
Wondering
If I'm O.K.
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost...
You said go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost...
...time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time

I got an effected sandstorm yesternight
and had a sick feel about the fancy bird
ただの imagine nation 混ざり合って coming away
流れてく waste no time in...

Color of the day
The answer that I want it back today

沈みゆく陽が照らす君のその横顔は
悲しみと共に闇に溶けてゆくシルエット

You wrote my name on the front of your tag
Keep my blank eyes on you, Nancy rock
Thankies, roundabout 巡りあった stay in awake
偽者か? left in right

I got a disturbed miles to you for tonight
and had a sick feel about the tangy plane
更に imagine nation 弾き合って coming away
崩れてく waste no time in...

Close of the day
The answer that I want it back today

瞳閉じて僕らは遮る距離も越えて
重なってく夕陽が照らし出す道標

So what 時が無常に過ぎても
記憶は色褪せないだろう (Go where you want to go)
Anybody want another word is this
Prown and Stern, is heading to the way (Go where you want to go)
I'll get wise. Where did I go

So just sing it, the wait is over
More to feel it, deep within my sound

沈みゆく陽が照らす君のその横顔に
見とれてた全て物語る様な
When I close my eyes I still remember
Watched the sunset over your tearful view,
But
歪んでく君の瞳に写る僕のシルエット

As I walk along I wonder
What wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on I think of
the things we've done together
While our hearts were young

I'm walkin in the rain
to the park and I feel no pain
Wishin you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder I wa wa wa wa wonder
Why wa wa wa wa wa she run away
And I wonder where she will stayae
My little run away

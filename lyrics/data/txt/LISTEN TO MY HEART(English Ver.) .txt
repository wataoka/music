Woe Baby what can you see in your eyes
Across an advanse wind yeah
What imagine at the sky?
What do you do you want? Do you need?

Oh Baby When we're sad, we're bad
I phoned to you midnight call yeah
But I know it's never change
Yes, every loneliness is never die

(never say ever say never ever say)
Whenever time has gone
We found the many things
(every night every night never ever say)
The heart is never end, never ever never end

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream
Happy shining place woe that you want
Baby are you free? Baby are you sad?
Do you wanna have me living with you?

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream
Now we stand admit contrary wind
I believe you now
You can work it out
Dreams comes true

Woe Baby it's just the same after all
「It's no use crying over spilt milk」
This word is a commonplace
But now I say to say to you

Oh Baby no I can't say 「fall in love」
Because it is heavy heart for me
But I wanna gaze at you
please gaze at me tonight forever more

(never say ever say never ever say)
If we'll part if you'll say good-bye to me
(every night every night never ever say)
I'll never forget you never forget your eyes

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream
Maybe it's a long and widing road
Can I come across? Can I'm satisfied?
Can I have a kindly look and heart?

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream
There is a place where we can go
Wind is blowing so gentle like your smile
Dreams comes true

(never say ever say never ever say)
Whenever time has gone
We found the many things
(every night every night never ever say)
The heart is never end, never ever never end

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream
Happy shining place woe that you want
Baby are you free? Baby are you sad?
Do you wanna have me living with you?

Listen to my heart, Looking for your dream
Now we stand admit contrary wind
I belive you now
You can work it out
Dreams comes true

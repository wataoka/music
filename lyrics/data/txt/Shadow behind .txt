Shadows and lights in the morning
その終われない僕のbehind
また拭えない日々のbehind
Shadow behind

Hidden door nobody knows it
その知られない部屋でalone
まだ始まらない僕はalone
Leave me alone

Knowing is easier than having something real
その薄れない記憶はlove
愛がlost in thought
Lost in thought

Listen to the music
その変わらない想いはfine
また訪れる痛みもfine
It'll be fine, fine

Nobody knows me 虚ろなweekend
でも想い出は妙にhigh
ただ君の色が
Out of sight, out of mind

Knowing is easier than having something real
その愛したい記憶もlove
愛がlost in thought
Lost in thought, I'm lost in thought
I'm lost in thought
Shadow behind, shadow behind
Shadow behind

And I say it to myself that
I'm not afraid of love

Shadows and lights in the morning
その終われない僕のbehind
また拭えない日々のbehind
Shadow behind, shadow behind
Shadow behind

Knowing is easier than having something real
Dying is easier than living for something real
その薄れない明日へ唄うLove
思い知るego and I
愛がlost in thought
Lost in thought, I'm lost in thought
I'm lost in thought
Shadow behind, shadow behind
Shadow behind
You see me alone, you see me alone
You see me alone

And I say it to myself that
I'm not afraid of love

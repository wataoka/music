THERE IS A BRIGHTNESS
IT'S LIKE THE SUNSHINE
THAT COMES DOWN AMONG THE TREES
AND KISSES THE GROUNDS

THE CITY IS LIKE A MAZE
WE ALL NEVER FLY
WE FEEL THE LONELINESS

THERE IS A WATER
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
THEY KEEP RUNNING TOWARDS A DREAM
REACHING TO BE FREE

IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF DESPAIR
PLEASE COME TO MY PRECIOUS WORLD
THE SECRET GARDEN'S HERE

※
WE CAN FLY AWAY
AND WE CAN TALK HEART TO HEART
LET'S GET TO PARADISE WITH INVISIBLE WINGS
SOMEDAY OUR DREAMS WILL COME TRUE
SO WE CAN FIND THE WAY
YES WE CAN STAY TOGETHER NOW
BECAUSE THERE IS HOPE FOR EVERYONE
THE SECRET GARDEN'S WAITING FOR YOU
※

THERE ARE MANY FLOWERS
IT'S SO LOVELY
THEY STAY IN YOUR HEART
YES FOREVER MORE

YOU ARE MY SPECIAL FRIEND
PLEASE COME TO MY PRECIOUS WORLD
THE SECRET GARDEN'S HERE

MY FRIEND
WE CAN FLY
WE CAN SMILE
LET'S MAKE A DREAM

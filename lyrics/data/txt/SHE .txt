She maybe the face I can't forget
The trace of pleasure or regret
Maybe my treasure or the price I have to pay
She maybe the song that summer sings
Maybe the chill that autumn brings
Maybe a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day

She maybe the beauty or the beast
Maybe the phantom or the feast
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell

She maybe the mirror of my dreams
The smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem inside her shell

She who always seems so happy in her proud
Who's eyes can be so prouder than so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
She maybe the love that cannot hold to last
May comes a need from shadows of the past
That I remember till the day I die
She maybe the reason I survive
The Why and when for I'm alive

The one I care for through the rough in many years
Me I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is

She...She...She...

High above the beautiful sky 
Listen to the whispering words of the wind, blessing on you 
Gentle wind blows up on a hill 
Sing a song on lightly birds of a charm, touching on you 

It's Calling your name, warming your heart 
Darling, if you could be pleased to be here 
It's Calling my name, warming my heart 
Praying for you to be happy and joy, merciful days 

And so... It's Calling your name, warming your heart 
Darling, if you could see a wonderful world 
It's Calling my name, warming my heart 
Praying for you to be happy and joy, graceful days 

When the sunset flowing the sky 
Twinkle stars are shining on you and your days, bright and spark 
Moonlight glows a magical view 
Leading to the secrets hiding in the woods, way to be wise 

It's Calling your name, warming your heart 
Darling, if you could be pleased to be here 
It's Calling my name, warming my heart 
Praying for you to be happy and joy, merciful days 

And so... It's Calling your name, warming your heart 
Darling, if you could see a wonderful world 
It's Calling my name, warming my heart 
Praying for you to be happy and joy, graceful days

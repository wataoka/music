When I see you When I feel you
I will give you eternal love
When I need you When I dream you
Every scene came misty blue

If I see you If I feel you
If you touch inside my heart
Every days and every night
Every pains in a memories

Living the way of destiny
Loving the way in a fantasy
Clear the tears you pass me by
Don't turn back and change the wind of all

This is a way to Utopia
Finding a way to Dystopia
Breaking the law of a crimson rage of lord
Even the storm breaks us apart
We never stop in going apart
Running a free dom way

wow wow wow wow Utopia

When I see you When I feel you
I will give you eternal love
I can see you I dream you
I believe our destiny

When I hold you Arms around you
If you can't show me the love
Many tears Can you hear
Dry the tears of memories

Tell the meaning of loneliness
Lead the way to the glory days
I promise to the end
Take my hand and gimme love for all

Starry night in Distancia
Symphony of Fantasia
Winner takes it all everything in the name of love
Stories of Fantasia
Find a way in Frontier
Dreaming saints o days

wow wow wow wow Fantasia
wow wow wow wow Frontier

If I lose you If I leave you
Even this love end apart
I'll touch you I'll hold you
I will save this love for you

Burn the age of eternity
Turn the page of reality
No regret is on my mind
Show me your love gimme all your love

This is a way to Utopia
Faraway to Arcadia
Breaking the law with a crimson rage of lord
Even the storm breaks us apart
We never stop in going apart
Dreaming saints of days

wow wow wow wow Frontier

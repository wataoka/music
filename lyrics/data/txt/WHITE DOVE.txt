Deals of passions come to deliver us
Even the sorrow runs to silvers dust

I can recall the falls of the lonely hearts
Betraying love and walls of fear

When you cry all tears are stolen
As I whisper golds in women
When the world is so far apart
We listen for voices in our hearts
Then touch
If we know love will show
How I care
Why we love beloved

＊And when Doves fly I think of love
　As in this world I've learned to see
　Can you believe the sight
　For us Doves clear and white
　In full flower

　And we learn to love and beloved
　Molding for one and all for none
　Women who share and men with care
　For one love
　Where the White Doves can flower

＊Repeat

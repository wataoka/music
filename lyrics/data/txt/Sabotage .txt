I Can't Stand It I Know You Planned It
I'm Gonna Set It Straight, This Watergate

I Can't Stand Rocking When I'm In Here
Because Your Crystal Ball Ain't So Crystal Clear So
While You Sit Back and Wonder Why

I Got This Fucking Thorn In My Side

Oh My God, It's A Mirage
I'm Tellin' Y'all It's Sabotage

So So So

So Listen Up 'Cause You Can't Say Nothin'
You'll Shut Me Down With A Push Of Your Button? But Yo

I'm Out And I'm Gone
I'll Tell You Now I Keep It On And On

Cause What You See You Might Not Get
And We Can Bet So Don't You Get Souped Yet

You're Scheming On A Thing That's someone's noise
I'm Trying To Tell You Now It's Sabotage

Whyyy;

Our Backs Are Now Against The Wall

Listen All Of Y'all It's A Sabotage
Listen All Of Y'all It's A Sabotage
Listen All Of Y'all It's A Sabotage
Listen All Of Y'all It's A Sabotage

I Can't Stand It, I Know You Planned It
But I'm Gonna Set It Straight This Watergate
But I Can't Stand Rockin' When I'm In This Place
Because I Feel Disgrace Because You're All In My Face
But Make No Mistakes And Switch Up My Channel

I'm Buddy Rich When I Fly Off The Handle
What Could It Be, It's someone's noise
You're Scheming On A Thing - That's Sabotage

twinkle stars
silent night
and summer steps

the silver moon
wet with rain
and summer smells

I heard SATIE

SATIE SATIE
sounds of SATIE
SATIE SATIE
sounds of SATIE

south wind
acerola tears
and summer lies

"good bye"
after you
kiss me good bye

I heard SATIE

SATIE SATIE
why did you say love me?
SATIE SATIE
so why didn't you kill me?

SATIE SATIE
How I shut my cars again
SATIE SATIE
sounds in my head
SATIE SATIE
love is gone
SATIE SATIE
say, it's over

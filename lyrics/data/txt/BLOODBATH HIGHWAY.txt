☆Dare to beat us if you wanna
　Try and race us,
　Fear our wrath
　Dare in vain,
　And you're a goner
　Bloodbath Highway,
　That's the path

Me &amp; my lovely craft
Evaded that damned draft
We haunt this lonesome
Expressway
She knows my every whim
Her sleekness never dims
The Queen who wanders
Through the waste

☆Repeat

I've got the sense of speed
She knows what I would need:
The fastest hardware
On this earth
We're hunters on the road
We leave a blood-red rose
We're wreaking havoc
In our mirth

☆Repeat

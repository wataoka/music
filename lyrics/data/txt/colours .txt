dark red The colour of your blood drawing the wrist

cobalt blue The colour of the sky holding it all

pale purple Umbrella, you keep from me trembling

true orange Everything coloured by the setting sun

chrome yellow You said to me it calls us happiness

moss green The hills of our town which kept us there

scarlet The colour of the children's cheek you loved

snow white It covered every sorrows among us

Colourful world we had been everywhere we're standing
Coloruful world we had lost everything
But you were standing, you were breathing just there
Under that each colours

Every light on the street had meaning of each story
Everyone believed in life day by day
But we would start it, we must start again ourselves
Put on the new colours again

light blond You showed me your calm hair proudly

bright gold The picture frame you always smile at me

silver The carved spoon we bought to start our life

dull grey I dyed all in all after you have gone

transparent The heart of the baby born today

flesh colour Seeing my hand grasped tightly

all black The colour of beginning of new days

deep brown Walking this land we have to go forward

Colourful world we had been everywhere we're standing
Colourful world we had lost everything
But you were standing, you were breathing just there
Under that each colours

Every light on the street had meaning of each story
Everyone believed in life day by day
But we would start it, we must start again ourselves
Go on the road
good bye

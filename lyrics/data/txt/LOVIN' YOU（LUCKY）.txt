I ain't got any worries and
I ain't got any money
But luck seems to follow
Wherever I go
When you said hello
My luck disappeared
You didn't even know I cared

★I got my Kings and Aces
　And I'm winnin' at the races
　But I ain't lucky
　If you don't love me
　So maybe I'll keep tryin'
　Till my luck starts tumin'
　Till someday maybe you'd love me.

★★Lucky-I can't be lucky in love
　　All my four leaf clovers can't do me no good.
　　Funny, just when I needed to be lucky
　　Couldn't help but loving you
　　Lovin' you...

God good luck charms to offer
But they don't win you over
Better think of something else to do
But now I learned to love you
Don't know what to do
So hopelessly in love with you

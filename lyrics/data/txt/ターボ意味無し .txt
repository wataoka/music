毎日朝から暗くなるころまで
どこからくるのか 通りをすべて埋めつくす

あたりにどす黒い息をまき散らして
どこにも行けない あわれな生き物

聞こえてくるのは車たちの
悶える声
ほら聞こえるだろ あいつらの震える声

turbo(imi nashi)

everyday, when morning comes
until the dark of night is calling

i don't know where they all come from
taking the space 'til there is no moving at all
filling the air with breath burning black
so pitiful and barely crawlin'

nowhere to go just killing time
poor creatures with nowhere to run

if you listen
then you may hear
the chokin' voices and torment they keep cryin'

everyday, when morning comes
until the dark of night is calling

nowhere to go just killing time
poor creatures with nowhere to run

if you try now, well you will hear
voices trembling sure as they are cryin'

cryin'
they are cryin'

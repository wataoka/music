Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog baby
But I still want you round

You give me the creeps
When you jump on your feet
So get down, get down, get down
Keep your hands to yourself
I'm strictly out of bounds

Once upon a time I dranks a little wine
Was as happy as could be, happy as could be
Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby what do you think you're doin' to me

Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
So get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog baby
But I still want you round around
I still want you around
aye aye aye

I don't give a damn
And I'd like you if you can to
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog baby
But I still want you, round

Once upon a time I drank a little wine
Was as happy as could be, happy as could be
Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby what do you think you're doin' to me

Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
So get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog baby
But I still want you round-around
I still want you around 
Mm- Mm- Mm-
Oo- Oo- Oo-
Oo oo oo
Bad Baby. bad dog Baby

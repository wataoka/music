3,2,1,Dead

I'm singin' here to get rid of fear.
Hope it disappears right here with the rain.
But I know life is pain. not like a fairy tale.
Meaningless to pray, just goin' on my way.

とめどない この痛みと やりきれない 怒りと苛立ち
Bleedin' from my eyes cuz of a pack of lies that binds up my mind
so that I can't escape.

Hey GOD, can you feel the pain you give to me?
Kill me heavenly before I awake.
Why you do to me? just hatin' me?
Even if it's destiny, I don't run away.

夢も希望も無いエンディングの
虚しいお伽話なんて誰も見たくはない
I Don't wanna see
I Don't wanna see anymore.

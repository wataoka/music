We're born as a white ball
Not polluted by anyone, anything
But it changes if time passes
Turning into every color we have

Even if you get so dirty
Even someone bring you down
You don't give up, keep on searching
There is chance to become winning ball, Yeah

時に悔しすぎて流した涙はさぁ
一つ一つが今後の君の宝物になるはずさ!!

Just search it, don't wait for the lay
Don't give in, keep trying to look for the light
If I can make my step, shine will come
It's like a spotlight on the stage
At last, chance will come for everyone
Please don't think you are lost and you're alone
There is somebody watching you
Don't be afraid to overcome yourself, Yeah

Everyone is not perfect
People always try to be perfect
Getting dirty or getting colored
Never means to become imperfect

Even if you're in frustration
Even you're out of desperation
When you're feeling an isolation
They will come back to you as a function

何かを突き付けられてる毎日なら
日々の努力で何か突き付ける毎日に変えりゃいい

Just search it, don't wait for the lay
Don't give in, keep trying to look for the light
If I can make my step, shine will come
It's like a spotlight on the stage
At last, chance will come for everyone
Please don't think you are lost and you're alone
There is somebody watching you
Don't be afraid to overcome yourself, Yeah

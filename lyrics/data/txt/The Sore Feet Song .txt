I walked ten thousand miles, ten thousands miles to reach you
And ever gasp to breath, I grabbed it just to find you
I climbed up every hill to get to you
I wandered ancient lands to hold just you

And every single step of the way, I paid
Every single night and day I searched for you
Through sand storms and hazy dawns I reached for you

I stole ten thousands pounds, ten thousand pounds to see you
I robbed convenience sotres coz I thought they'd make it easier
I lived off rats and toads and I starved for you
I fought off giant bears and I killed them too

And every single step of the way, I paid
Every single night and day I searched for you
Through sand storms and hazy dawns I reached for you
I'm tired and I'm weak but I'm strong for you
I want to go home but my love gets me through

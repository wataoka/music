Blast and fire!

Never think of there's a limit day.
The real will come soon I don't wanna say.
I wanna set my fears at rest for a while.
I wanna put my clouds in everlasting life.

“Sure!”“Safe!” depend on these.
“Slow!”“Life!” waste my weeks. 123
Like a suicide, sway your soul. 1234 (1234)

The world is nothing now. (nothing now.)
You'll ever be nothing oh. (nothing oh.)
Already started counting down.(counting down.) 1234 (1234)

Wow oh, what a time flying concrete jungles!
Wow oh, what can you do in a brief time?
Wow oh, what life will you be proud of?
Wow oh, you're dead or alive for joy!

The world is nothing now. (nothing now.)
You'll ever be nothing oh. (nothing oh.)
Already started counting down. (counting down.) Counting down.

“Sure!”“Safe!” depend on these
“Slow!”“Life!” waste my weeks.
“Sure!”“Safe!” depend on these.
“Slow!”“Life!” your dead or alive for joy!

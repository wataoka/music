Verse1:
I don't know much about love but I see
every time you look into her eyes
there is a spark a deep connection
that you could never hide away

Verse2:
she wishes that she could fly
she wishes to run away with you
To that field where you lie
into your arms again

Chorus:
You showed her what love really is
You taught her all the ways how to live
There will always be days she'll need you
And in your heart you know

if only you could see the way
she looks at you everyday
thinking back on those days with you
there's no one else you know it too

bridge:
cuz every waking moment
she wants to be with you
6 years have passed
and she's still addicted
she had the pleasure to
meet other guys but its true
I am head over heals for you

Verse3:
i wish that i could fly
i wish to run away with you
To that field where you lie
into your arms again

Chorus:
You showed me what love really is
You taught me all the ways how to live
There will always be days I'll need you
And in your heart you know

if only you could see the way
i look at you everyday
thinking back on those days with you
there's no one else you know it too

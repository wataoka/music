Big blue sky above me
Two humming birds flying
They seem so very happy
Chasing little foot prints run after my shadow
I wonder what I'm like to them

Time will tell you the truth someday
Time is fair to all people, yeah
I wish that I could fly into the sky like those birds

Take my time to go
No matter how far I'm gonna walk on
Feel the sunshine on my face like wild flowers
Take my time to go 
All I ever need to know is all in my mind
It's an ordinary day but a special day for me
Flow on peaceful time

One mistake of yesterday precious failure of yours
Everything was meant to be
It's never for nothing 
It's never too late
It's all right, that's up to you

Time will tell the truth someday
Time goes round and round, oh yeah
We're just only a speak in this wide universe

Take your time to go 
No more of your pain to keep you down low
Get where we should be going like a sailing ship
Take your time to go 
No one can control the winds of change
It's an ordinary day but a special day for you
Flow on peaceful time

Take my time to go 
No matter how far I'm gonna walk on
Feel the sunshine on my face like wild flowers
Take my time to go 
All I ever need to know is all in my mind
It's an ordinary day but a special day for me
Flow on peaceful time

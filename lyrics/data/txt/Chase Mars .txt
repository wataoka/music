Sun's going down
Sky turns to brown
I don't care 'bout the time and sunset

Night spawns the stars
Look up to Mars
Burning red, burning red
Running away

Never fade out
Mars growing dark
Stars falling down
I chase it through the night

Never fade out
I don't give up
I'll keep on chasing stars tonight

Earth's going down
Take a look around
Why can't anyone see it dying

Feel the heat of the ground
Hear the crying sound
Living dead, living dead
This is the end

Never fade out
Mars growing dark
Stars falling down
I chase it through the night

Never fade out
I don't give up
I'll keep on chasing stars tonight

Never fade out
Mars growing dark
Stars falling down
I chase it through the night

Never fade out
I don't give up
Even if this is the end
And even if we fall dead
I'll keep on chasing stars tonight

You almost always
Spend the best time to
Figure money and ease
And let yourself cry

When the earth was still so plane
ここに辿り着く
蒼と緑
どこにいこうかな

まっくら闇のなか
火を灯し
眠る　paradise incompleteness
目覚めの頃には
小鳥と歌う
朝の　party of the sun

&quot;There's a place to be
Village surrounded by the wheat
And within it
Waitin' new story

There's a place to see
Mountain stretched up to the sky
On top of it
God will always be&quot;

You almost always
Spend the best time to
Figure money and ease
And let yourself cry

Soon we start to built the things
世界を支配した
金と銀のコイン
誰もが夢中

&quot;There's a place to be
City surrounded by the gold
And within it
Waitin' new profit

There's a place to see
Building stretched up to the sky
On top of it
Greed will always be&quot;

You almost always
Spend the best time to
Figure money and ease
And let yourself cry

You almost always...

Figure money and ease...

So we can rock it day and night
You'll people play and know it
You can drive in your four by four
And you follow on so
Bring up yeah you day and night
Non stop you'll getting down
But still want more
Can nobody take it back so

You almost always
Spend the best time to
Figure money and ease
And let yourself cry

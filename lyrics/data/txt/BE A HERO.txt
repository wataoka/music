Lost in a world gone mad
Danger so close at hand
Send out a message
Send out a signal
Send for somebody to rescue you
No one can hear you
No one is near you
You start to panic, frantic
What to do

Trouble is all around
You're slowly losing ground
You can't get over
You can't go under
And there's a thundering in your heart
No, you're not dreaming
You start to scream and
You know it's real, you feel it
Come apart

Nothing comes easy
Nothing comes easy
You've gotta stand up tall
Even when you back is up against the wall

Be a hero, be a hero
No nobady's gonna save you
You have got to save yourself
Be a hero, be a hero
Only you can be a hero
You and you alone and no one else

You're out there on your own
So far away from home
Nowhere to run now
Nowhere to hide now
You know they'll find you before too long
Freedom's at stake now
No time to waste now
You're in the race so face them
Take them on

Nothing comes easy
Nothing comes easy
You've gotta stand and fight
For the things in right
You know are true and right

＊Be a hero, be a hero
　No nobody's gonna save you
　You have got to save yourself
　Be a hero, be a hero
　Only you can be a hero
　You and you alone and no one else

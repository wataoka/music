You are my honey, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, you came into my life
Oh, when you hold me tight
You make me feel like a queen

You are my honey, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, you came into my life
Oh, when you hold me tight
You make me feel like a queen

Love is in the air
Counting all the birds in the sky
I don't have a care
Dancing with you in the sun
I can't wait to say
How much I always love you so
And now my life is better
Everyday and night

Can't get enough
It's never enough（Let's make it）
Let's make it together
Love lift up us to the top

You are my honey, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, you come into my life
Oh, when you hold me tight
You make me feel like a queen

You're my baby, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, I was found by you
We start a brand new day
Every day is like a queen

Just to see you again
It feels just like a paradise
Just to kiss you again
I can't stop thinking of you
Please promise me now
That you will never go away
You move into my life
All the secret wind

I'll be here forever
That's where I belong
We are born to love
I feel you so close to me

You are my honey, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, you come into my life
Oh, when you hold me tight
You make me feel like a queen

You are my baby, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, I was found by you
We start a brand new day
Every day is like a queen

Can't get enough
It's never enough（Let's make it）
Let's make it together
Love lift up us to the top

You are my honey, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, you come into my life
Oh, when you hold me tight
You make me feel like a queen

You are my baby, Sweet little darling
I'm so glad, I was found by you
We start a brand new day
Every day is like a queen

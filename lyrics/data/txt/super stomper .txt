Jump around! Jumping free! It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free! Say! Yeah! Yeah!

If our hearts weren't stained black.
Hate and anger would be a measure of the people we meet each day.
There's no need to defy. There's no need to kill.

Lies, bluffs make them the truth.
Deal with the small before the big.
There's no need to always be such a good boy or such a girl! Just blow!

No! Goody-two-shoes conscience-Go! Just stay outta my way!
Go! Get outta my way! Oh, I've got so much further to go!
No! Goody-two-shoes conscience-Go! Just stay outta my way!
Go! Get outta my way! Oh, everybody rise up! Yeah!

I might go crazy. My heart won't even move at all.
It's like memories just atart growing so bright.
I might go crazy. The future is so scary now.
Maybe one day can overcome.

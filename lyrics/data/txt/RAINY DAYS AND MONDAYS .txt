Talking to myself and feeling old
Sometimes I'd like to quit
Nothing ever seems to fit
Hang it around
Nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
What I've got faced to call the blues
Nothing is really wrong
Feeling like I don't belong
Waking around some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny but it seems I always wind up here with you

Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel is come and gone before

No need to talk it out
We know what it's all about
Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always gets me down

Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
What I feel is come and gone before
No need to talk it out
We know what it's all about

Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

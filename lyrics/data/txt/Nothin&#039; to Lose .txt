He played with confidence
The spoiled prince
So quick to call my bluff
But I won't press my luck
Time's on my side
No need to give it up
I don't know what to do
I wanna have my chips
and play 'em too
If its all or nothin'
I risk losing everything

Maybe Im losin' my mind
Never felt this way, no lie
Maybe I just need some time
The stakes are high
But hes one of a kind

If love is a gamble, hes a high roller
The King of Hearts
If I were to lose his love,
Back to square one
Then how would I go on?
Because every moment of everyday
I fall more in love
Hitori no hou ga raku
Cause when you got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

Hes got his eyes on the prize
Luck, strategy
Hes playin' his cards right
Bets placed,
My poker face is fadin'
He wants much more than just a
taste
All IN and no limit
Suddenly,
He reached out his hand to me
I held it proudly
Unaware of who could see

Maybe Im losin' my mind
Never felt this way, no lie
Maybe I just need some time
The stakes are high
But hes one of a kind

If love is a gamble, hes a high roller
The King of Hearts
If I were to lose his love,
Back to square one
Then how would I go on?
Because every moment of everyday
I fall more in love
Hitori no hou ga raku
Cause when you got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

I got a feeling in my heart
Lady luck's on my side tonight
But this aint a game no more
No chips, no dice, no cards
This is my life
Should I fold before stakes get high?
Before I get hurt again
Or take a chance on love to last all time
Whether or not I lose or win
Im goin' ALL IN

If love is a gamble, hes a high roller
The King of Hearts
If I were to lose his love,
Back to square one
Then how would I go on?
Tell me why every moment of everyday
I fall more in love
Hitori no hou ga raku
But no matter what cards are dealt
Im ALL IN just for you

If love is a gamble, hes a high roller
The King of Hearts
If I were to lose his love,
Back to square one
Then how would I go on?
Because every moment of everyday
I fall more in love
Hitori no hou ga raku
Cause when you got nothin'
You got nothin' to lose

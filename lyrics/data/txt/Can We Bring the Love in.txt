You don't fade away
Your voice is like the whispering of the widest ocean
That carries me here
I won't go astray
There's no other place for me to lay down
Without your touch

In the hour that I needed you
Your love came here to call on me
Cause she knew I'd be strong
Strong enough to find my way to you
And now I need to know that
You can find me too

※I see your face like light oh so bright I could love you
　I watch the tears run dry say goodbye to the years you knew before
　Open up another page
　No more games we have to play
　Oh love is here just knocking on our door
　Can we bring the love in

There's no other way
Who can come between your world when fate is calling
Calling your name out
There no words to say
Everything you need to know will just fall
Right into place

What we share it won't be seasonal
Everyday another trace
Of learning who we are
How to love without the wading storm
I wanna crawl right into you to get back home

I see your face like light oh so bright I could love you
I watch my tears run dry I say goodbye
To the years I've known before
We'll open up another page
We don't have to play those games
Oh love is here still knocking on our door
Can we bring the love in

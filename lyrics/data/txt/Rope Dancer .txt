I'm facing the air
climbing invisible stairs
I'm alone and shaking
like a rope dancer
It's calm and warm
Feels like before the storm
But I'm scared deep down
like a rope dancer

If you say you can catch me
when I fall from above
I'd try to make it
with the mystery of love
This game is so hard to win
But I'll stay to the bitter end
Baby I'll make it
if you give me a chance

I'm walking in hope
on an unstable rope
People say
I've got a nice lifestyle
I don't need much
But I want you to be there in the clutch
so that I could be brave
like a rope dancer

If you say you can catch me
when I fall from above
I'd try to make it
with the mystery of love
This game is so hard to win
But I'll stay to the bitter end
Baby I'll make it
if you give me the strength...the strength

I'm howling out loud
to keep my balance somehow
I'm alone and fighting
against danger
It's tough
It's rough
But I know where there's a will,
there's a way

If you say you can catch me
when I fall from above
I'd try to make it
with the mystery of love
This game is so hard to win
But I'll stay to the bitter end
Baby I'll make it
if you give me a chance

one more chance
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?

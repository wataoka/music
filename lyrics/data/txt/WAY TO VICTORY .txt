Always believe your possibilities Don't ever give up
Vision yourself to your win, way to victory

Legend of a warrior once told stories of a fight
Of unknown enemies
Until the end of history, never did he lose a fight
For what he always believed

But things sometimes didn't work out the-wa-y he planned but
with hearts on fire he evened out the score

So break out strong, you've got the power go!
Don't ever stop just keep the image of victory
Always believe your possibilities. Don't ever give up
Vision yourself at the top, that's your destiny

When you're out in battle world, you must fight in solitude
Be wise and stay alive
Until the final thrill of fight, comes to action for the truth
Of what he ha-s achieved

Arise with burst of flame to knock out your worst nightmares to slee-p
Carry out the force

So break out strong, you've got the power go!
Don't ever stop just keep the image of victory
Always believe your possibilities Don't ever give up
Vision yourself to your win, way to victory

Walls are there to be destroyed
Defeat your own fear go!
Take a chance and see it through
You'll be making new history made by you

So stand up tall, Just trust your heart and go!
And listen to the voice, the words of a warrior
believe your possibilities. Don't ever give up
Vision yourself at the top, that's your destiny

That's your destiny, way to victory.

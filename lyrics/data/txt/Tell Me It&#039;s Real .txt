Tell me it's real
The feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come Just to pass us by
Try, is all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

Baby you told me that you love me
And you'd never leave my side

To the bitter end,through the thick and thin
You promised me baby that you wasn't going anywhere
Baby keep it real
Let me know just how you feel

Tell me it's real
The feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come Just to pass us by
Try, is all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

I can't explain the way you make me feel
Everytime that you told me that you loved me
And you know you did, too many times

Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me
That's when you came along and showed me happiness
Baby you are the best I think you're different from the rest
I think you're different from the rest
And I really love you

Tell me it's real
The feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come Just to pass us by
Try, is all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

Tell me it's real
The feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
For your love
I'll do anything

Tell me that it's real
The feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come Just to pass us by
Try, is all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more
Do you really love me
Do you really care
You promised that you'd always be there
You promised that you'd never leave my side
I'll be there for you baby
If you'll be there for me sweetheart
I thought we were meant to be for eternity
Thought you loved me baby
And mama told me take it show
Boy you just don't know anything about love
And if you and I were meant to be
Then you would know
It would show by the end of this song

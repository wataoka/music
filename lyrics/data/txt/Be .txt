I have not thought about living until yesterday
It just a seemed like one scene of a film
I need lore

Oh, everything has utterly changed
泣きそうになるくらい
目を塞いでも変わらない
思いが反比例

Close your eyes
Imagine how to live
You must do it
I close my eyes
And determined
I'm pressed for choice
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
We gotta choose it
So do we?
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
Can you drive your destiny?
Be it

Every body go
残酷な世界を旅する
生きるしかChanceは無い
どれだけ目を塞いだって
チクタク迫り来る終焉を
選択肢は無い
答えを探してあがいてもがいても見えない
争い奪って壊し合って繰り返しても止めない
もうどこに居たって同じだって
だから僕は止まらない
また日が沈んで行く

Hold your hand
You don't to meet someone's end no more
So do I
For not to leave
Don't wanna get a wrong choice
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
We gotta choose it
So do we?
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
Can you drive your destiny?
Be it

Why? How?
They disappeared.
Still I don't get it, for real
Combine forces you & me.
We trust to get back the peace

Close your eyes
Imagine how to live
You must do it
I close my eyes
And determined
I'm pressed for choice
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
We gotta choose it
So do we?
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
Can you drive your destiny?
Be it

Close your eyes
Imagine how to live
You must do it
I close my eyes
And determined
I'm pressed for choice
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
We gotta choose it
So do we?
Just about a leave, faraway
生きるため
Its only one
Can you drive your destiny?
Be it

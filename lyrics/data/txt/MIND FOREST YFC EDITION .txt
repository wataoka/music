I saw you dancing in a sea of light
Playful as if nothing was on your mind
Upon the voices floating from the trees
Feeling of happiness filled me

Now broken dreams have clouded everything
All that remains of our eternity
Gracefully hands left holding tragedies
Feeling of emptiness fills me

Never to return again
From the abyss of endlessness
Every moment that we shared is now being taken away
from me
Nothing could ever eclipse those days
Through the sadness and the pain
Every memory that we made will stay
Forever radiant

Calling to me from somewhere far away
A melody is faintly ringing
Something within me has become awake
Nothing can stop me from seeking

If only I could be with you
Find someway to just make you see
Fall away inside of your kiss again
And stay foreverâ€¦

And when I fall I won't fall very far
So make a wish and catch this falling star

Tonight I'll lose myself inside your eyes
Tonight they'll be no turning back defeating wrong for right

Rock and Roll would you be my hero
Could you be my saviour if I called your name

Rock and Roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know you'll rescue me somehow

Here We Go Rock and Roll now

And when I cry I won't cry very long
He always knows I just sing his favorite song

Tonight I'll lose myself inside your eyes
Tonight they'll be no turning back defeating wrong for right

Rock and Roll would you be my hero
Could you be my saviour if I called your name

Rock and Roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know you'll rescue me somehow

Here We Go Rock and Roll now
Here We Go Rock and Roll now

Would you ever be my friend
The type to marry in the end
Could you hang your suit up for my love

All those helpless boys and girls
Calling out around the world
Need you much more tonight than this lovesick little girl

Tonight I'll lose myself inside your eyes
Tonight they'll be no turning back defeating wrong for right

Rock and Roll would you be my hero
Could you be my saviour if I called your name

Rock and Roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know you'll rescue me somehow

Rock and Roll would you be my hero
Could you be my saviour if I called your name

Rock and Roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know you'll rescue me somehow

Here We Go Rock and Roll now
Here We Go Rock and Roll now
Here We Go Rock and Roll now

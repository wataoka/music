You always wish upon stars
I don't know what you long for
Because everything that I need is here by my side
We named some stars out of reach
Listend to the wind sung
We are little kids but
We know what is worth for us

Someday you'll find that what you've been longing for is
Here in this small town you don't like
Someday I say the words I've never said to anyone else

You make me smile, make me cry,
Make me feel that I can fly
Sure you belong to me like I belong to you
I said,
“I'm on your side even when you are wrong”
I wanna be your hero to save you
From everything that hurt you

One day on the way home
You took my hand and kissed me
It's so sudden that I failed to close my eyes
Time has come, I shouted
But you told me you would go away
I couldn't say anything that I'd been ready to say

The day has come and gone on a sudden
I thought those were the best days with you
But you were trying to find another place in this world
I should have known

You gave me a kiss, gave me love,
Gave me my first goodbye
If I could give you what you really want
has something changed? It's too late?
My first kiss told me good bye for the first time
I'll miss you
Don't go my girl

We are waiting for your bus
I've neverthought such a day came
The bus comes slowly to take you someday I can't see

You're gonnna find someone who needs you like I do
He would say the words to you I could not say
Tears in your eyes tall quietly
We both can't say the words we have to say

The dream I thought we shared has gone
But I stand on your side anytime
Even when you are wrong
I send my kiss, send my love,
Send my goodbye to you
You are the one I've ever wanted
This is my love

Watching through the windowpane
Seeing all the people come and go
Trying to escape the storm
They're moving fast
We're moving slow

Watching that sky up above turn grey
While inside we just sit and wait
Soon all the clouds will amass below
And then out into the water we will go

We see it coming down (and down, and down)
And scatter all around (around, around)
The pitter patter sound (the sound, the sound)

We let it come and wash away the worries
Wipe away our every care (our care, our care)
We'll watch is disappear (appear, appear)
And vanish in the air (the air, the air)

And when it ceases
We will be there standing
Waiting‘til the sun comes out

Looking though the icy glass
Watching how the white descends below
Seeing all the children pass
Some looking up
Some looking cold

Watching that sky up above turn grey
While inside we just sit and wait
Soon all the ice will amass below
And then out into the winter we will go

We see it coming down (and down, and down)
And scatter all around (around, around)
The pitter patter sound (the sound, the sound)

We let it come and wash away the worries
Wipe away our every care (our care, our care)
We'll watch is disappear (appear, appear)
And vanish in the air (the air, the air)

And when it ceases
We will be there standing
Waiting‘til the sun comes out

Out into the air you'll want to go with me
Underneath the sky you'll want to dance with me
Stay with me

We see it coming down (and down, and down)
And scatter all around (around, around)
The pitter patter sound (the sound, the sound)

We let it come and wash away the worries
Wipe away our every care (our care, our care)
We'll watch is disappear (appear, appear)
And vanish in the air (the air, the air)

And when it ceases
We will be there standing
Waiting‘til the sun comes out

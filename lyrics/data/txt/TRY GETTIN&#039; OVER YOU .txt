I talk to a friend of ours
Just late last night
She said you'd been drowin' in your tears
I know that it might sound strange
Never wanted to cause you pain
But her words were like music to my ears

Maybe we could walk away
And turn our backs on yesterday
Just move on the way most lovers do
But that's not how this story goes
I'll tell ya now what heaven knows
If gettin' over me is hard to do
Well, baby you should try gettin' over you

The smile on your face was all you let me see
So I couldn't bear to let you know
While hiding behind my pride
I wanted to die inside
Just lookin' for signs you'd never show

Maybe we could walk away
And turn our backs on yesterday
Just move on the way most lovers do
But that's not how this story goes
I'll tell ya now what heaven knows
If gettin' over me is hard to do
Well, baby you should try gettin' over you

It seems we've played our part too well
To find it in our hearts to tell…one another…
What we've both known all along
That since the day we said goodbye
We've just been livin' one big lie
It's time to face the fact that we were wrong
To think that…maybe we could walk away
And turn our backs on yesterday
Just move on the way most lovers do
Cause that's not how this story goes
I'll tell ya now what heaven knows
If gettin' over me is hard to do
Well, baby you should try
Maybe you should try
Baby you should try gettin' over you

Dear friend, How long I haven't heard help from you? 
Nothin' gonna special happen in my life 
Faces of the Sun & Moon still look the same 
but I found that such a long time's gone. I said, 

uh, you were my everything baby 
uh, you were the light shining up my life 
Now I could go on my way trying to step one by one 
～without your light as a guide～ 
You just live in my memories... 

Oh, the rain of sorrow striking me so deeply 
walking a long way of despair & loneliness, oh no 
Dancing with the empty heart, but after all 
Nothin's gonna scare me, trying to give a best shot 
This is my way 
～For your grateful love～I'm still longing you～ 
Thank you for your help 

Dear friend, I made it end up lately 
to chase the meanings & the answers of life 
It's not so hard to find the happiness 
Wanna be moved by beautiful smiles & tears, oh baby 

uh, I'm gonna fly away someday 
uh, to the place you're belonging to 
Now I wanna watch to the end 
of big confusion times～don't wanna take my eyes off～ 
Until I see you again 

Oh, when I met you, the whole world seemed to be for me 
black and white ～like all of nothing, oh no 
When I felt that I was standing no way out 
Blames on the people & world. 
I couldn't see the truth 
But now I know～you gave me the key～to open the door～ 
Thank you for your help

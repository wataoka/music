At tha party
Too many people in here
I'll try to ask you before you disappear
Tha relationships between you and I
Our story begins in tha meantime
I was wondering if you know of any other place we can chill

3 Days after that
I had dinner wit A Bad Mama Jama at this restrant
which managed a clothin' store on a separate
floor in tha same building
It was round about 4:00 a.m
Its atmosphere was unique
It feels so free to spend tha time wit you honey?!
Two is a company Three is a crowd
You know I mean?! Yea hun?! Whatever!

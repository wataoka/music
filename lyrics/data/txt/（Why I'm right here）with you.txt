walking away and you would stay
the passing days' continuing
slipping away but don't be afraid
ready or not we will meet again

I go and you go
the same direction we would choose you got it?
heading our future

when I woke up at morning
君の横顔照らす　sunlight　まぶしすぎて
what you're dreaming　想ってみたりして
再び目を閉じるそんな朝もいい
I like this you like that
そうすれ違いと言えば些細な事だけで
never mind never mind
時間と共に埋められていくものだから

I know and you know 
the same time we will spend for life you got it?
shine the light on us

I never forget the reason
why I'm right here with you
答えは二人のprophesy
I never forget the season
when started my life with you
このまま続いていくように

walking away and you would stay
the passing days' continuing
slipping away but don't be afraid
ready or not we will meet again

I go and you go
the same direction we would choose you got it?
heading our future

I never forget the reason
why I'm right here with you
答えは二人のprophesy
I never forget the season
when started my life with you
このまま続いていくように

if down in sadness I'll be there for you
come much closer to the other side
we've ever seen before

I never forget the reason
why I'm right here with you
答えは二人のprophesy
I never forget the season
when started my life with you
このまま続いていくように

I never forget the reason

I never forget the season

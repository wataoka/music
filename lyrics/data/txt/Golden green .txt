Stay there and sit around for only a few more minutes
And keep your eyes closed soft and deep
Up above in the clear sky, a spaceship rendezvous
To examine the cities on the earth

The bridge of colors my father once saw
Wanna catch a glimpse of it now
I really can't imagine what it was all like
The streets are covered with grey

All over the land those golden green
On the soil they silently grow
Only here once this shining star
Where we all live

Take a long and deep breath for only a few more seconds
Blow away the clouds from your head to toe
Think about the southern isle Tuvalu, the coast of coral
Going down and fading out of sight

If you don't remember the way of walking
Just stride in barefoot and run
The neighborhood park where you step on an earthworm
And you will smile at those seeds

Oh can you see over the star
There's a rainbow arching across
Goodbye for now and see you again
My dear spaceship!

All over the land those golden green
On the soil they silently grow
Only here once this shining star
Where we all live

Tonight the scenery, blue and navy in the sky
Why does it look different, so special to me?
Sapphire miracles here and there and everywhere
Don't you see it happen too forevermore?

Just the two of us if we put our hearts in one
Will the lines between us go and disappear?
Who knows someday sometime not so faraway
The time will come when they will hear the voice of wind

Look and find out the bottom of your two feet
What you're stepping on and onn right now

Listen to your footsteps we were born in beauty
Let us start and walk in this world

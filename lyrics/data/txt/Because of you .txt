Want to but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy n what is real
I need it when I want it,
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't

I got a problem and I
(don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did don't know,
If I would quit, but I doubt it
I'm, taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true,
Baby you, have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you, I can barely move,
But I like it.
And it's all because of you, (all because of you)
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug

Think of it every second,
I can't get nothin' done,
Only concern is the next time I'm gon' get me some
Know I should stay away from,
But it's no good for me
I try n try but my obsession, won't let me leave

I got a problem and I
(don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did don't know
If I would quit, but I doubt it
I'm, taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby you, have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you, I can barely move,
But I like it.
And it's all because of you, (all because of you)
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug

Ain't no doubt, so strung out,
Ain't no doubt, so strung out,
Over you, over you, over you, you

Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest, drug.
She's the sweetest drug

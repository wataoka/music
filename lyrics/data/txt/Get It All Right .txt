Get it all right
Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Get it all right
Don't hide away
Even though troubles on the way

Live for yourself
You can do what you want
Don't give up on your dreams
Better make a start
Open up your eyes
You will find your own way
Don't want you to miss the sign
Life is like a trick or treat

Doesn't matter what people may say
(What they say)
No more live in chains
Hold your thoughts and you will be fine

Get it all right, Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Takes it all night, make it all right
So come on now,(whole)world is waiting

Get it all right, Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Now or never, make it better
So come on now,(whole)world is waiting

Can't stop things we start
You have got to move on
Don't look back, Don't turn around
Better make it fast
When you lost in the dark
Try to remember when
You have a power to shine
Shining like the clear sky

May be it seems to be doing the same
(All the same)
Things over and over again
Sun comes up over your tears

Get it all right, Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Takes it all night, make it all right
So come on now,(whole)world is waiting

Get it all right, Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Now or never, make it better
So come on now,(whole)world is waiting

Live for yourself
You can do what you want
Don't give up on your dreams
Better make it start
Open up your eyes
You will find your own way
Don't want you to miss the sign
Life is like a trick or treat

Doesn't matter what people may say
What they say
No more live in chains
Hold your thoughts and you'll be fine

Get it all right, Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Takes it all night, make it all right
So come on now,(whole)world is waiting

Get it all right, Don't wonder why
Even though troubles on the way
Now or never, make it better
So come on now,(whole)world is waiting

Get it all right
Don't wonder why
Get it all right
Don't hide away

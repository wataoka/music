The party is not over
We can get down on the floor
Feels like dancing in a rainbow
I wanna know about you more

Can I call you in the middle of the night?
テレパシー感じてくれたの?
心読まれてる 気がするの

Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You make me wonder
I don't care who you are
Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You take me far away
You shine everywhere

Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You make me wonder
I don't care who you are
Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You take me far away
You shine everywhere

I've never met someone like you
that I want to tell you
Something tells me,you are
the kind of person, I've been looking for

Driving with you under the starlight
フロントミラー越し目が合う
ドキドキハートが飛び出そう

Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You make me wonder
I don't care who you are
Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You take me far away
You shine everywhere

Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You make me wonder
I don't care who you are
Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You take me far away
You shine everywhere

You are the starlight,reflects in my eyes
I'm Cinderella and you are my prince
Can you catching my vibes?
I want you for me,not anyone else
秘密のミッドナイトドライブ
気持ちの制限速度は
オーバーしているわとっくに

Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You make me wonder
I don't care who you are
Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You take me far away
You shine everywhere

Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You make me wonder
I don't care who you are
Twinkle,twinkle my super star
You take me far away
You shine everywhere

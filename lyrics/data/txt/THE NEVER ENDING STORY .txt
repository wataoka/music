Turn around
Look at what you see...
In her face
The mirror of your dreams...

Make believe I'm everywhere
I'm hidden in the lines
Written on the pages
Is the answer to our never ending story

Ah... Story... Ah...

Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy...
Dream a dream
And what you see will be...

Lines that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
There upon the rainbow
Is the answer to our never ending story

Ah... Story... Ah...

Show no fear
For she may fade away...

In your hands
The birth of a new day...

Lines that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
There upon the rainbow
Is the answer to our never ending story

Ah...
Never ending story
Ah...
Never ending story
Ah...
Never ending story
Ah...
Never ending story...

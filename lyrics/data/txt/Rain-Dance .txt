Keep your mind clear
You canhear the whisper of wind
Trees in the street are gently humming a peaceful love song

Now! Open the eyes of your heart
You will see all that you missed out on
The story just started now under the velvet cloud

You remember how to get to the station called wonderland
If you awake the sleeping sense
anyone can get there so easily

People coming and going, running across the street
Never stopping to take the time to smell the roses
Won't you come out to play?
Even though the sun's taken a break

Welcome to the world of the rain
singin' in the rain
Fill up your heart with pieces of joy
Let's get together 
knockin' a cheerful rhythm on the door that leads to the dream
Welcome to the world of the rain
dancin' in the rain
What a beautiful day
feels like flying
it's not bad on such a day
Take away all your pain with rain
dancin' in the rain

Keep your mind clear
You can hear the whisper of the wind
Trees in the street are gently humming a peaceful love song

Now! Open the eyes of your heart
You will see all that you missed out on
The story just strarted now under the velvet cloud

Welcome to the world of the rain
singin' in the rain
Fill up your heart with pieces of joy
Let's get together 
knockin' a cheerful rhythm on the door that leads to the dream
Welcome to the world of the rain
dancin' in the rain
What a beautiful day
feels like flying
it's not bad on such a day
Take away all your pain with rain
dancin' in the rain

Welcome to the world of the rain
singin' in the rain
Fill up your heart with pieces of joy
Let's get together 
knockin' a cheerful rhythm on the door that leads to the dream
Welcome to the world of the rain
dancin' in the rain
What a beautiful day
feels like flying
it's not bad on such a day
Take away all your pain with rain
dancin' in the rain

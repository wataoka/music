Today the star is bright lights up the way we'll go
Above the sky they cry the rain falls down to you all the way

Breathing softly remember what happend to us
Don't take it back no need to disconnect the past
But don't look back there's only way to choose

Today the star is bright lights up the way we'll go
Above the sky they cry the rain falls down to you all the way

May be everything you have done is nothing but reason the reason to live
Wake up for your past keep going on
future is waiting its waiting for you
stand up right now

Cold hands keep me alive

May be everything you have done is nothing but reason the reason to live
Wake up for your past keep going on
future is waiting its waiting for you

We won't forget your hands and lives until we will be on your side

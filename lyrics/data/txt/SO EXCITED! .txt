Give me some rich foods
And take me outside of my cell
Homing pigeon is gone
Who lost out, and gave out and died

So that famous actor has put on weight
He has a double chin looks that way to stay
For duty, oh well, he must need that much
Play the ice pick, take out here

And now you think I
Don't have anything do you
I just have pride, maybe
I can do something I must be seriously challenged

So that famous actor has put on weight
He has a double chin looks that way to stay
For duty, oh well, he must need that much
Play the ice pick, take out here

I'm free now, and so happy
The world is just for me, don't you think so?
And you're free, such a peace
This happiness is mine forever

Listen me baby, don't get angry please
Maybe I get back that fucking place again
I love you, believe me
And I who stabbed you
This is for you, and for my self

I'm free now, and so happy
The world is just for me, don't you think so?
And you're free, such a peace
This happiness is mine forever

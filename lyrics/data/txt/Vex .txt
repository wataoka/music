Your legs
It's like a clock running fast
I'm looking at it for a while
It's annoying

Your hair
It's like a pendulum swinging
My breathing is very heavy
But I don't care
I found something

Vexation
Her desires will be filled
It was my desire
She said ”I've finally arrived”
I found…

I can hear
I can tell
It's too late
Do you know?
But I can touch
But I can snatch
But it's too late
Why not everyone?

I found…

I can hear
I can tell
It's too late
Do you know?
But I can touch
But I can snatch
But it's too late
Why not everyone?

You know, you know

Get ready, for the night, for tonight
Get ready, the feeling's right, it's alright
Get ready, for the night, for tonight
Get ready, the feeling's right

Hey brother, when you come around
We're gonna have a party right here
Brother, brother, when you wanna get down
You know that you can get it right here
Don't you know you got me waiting all week
You know it seemed so long like a year
But now, the band's playing
And we are gonna party down

Hey sister, when life is getting you down
Just come and bring yourself over here
Sister,sister, don't you give me a frown
You know this ain't no time for no tears
You work too hard now,
you've been working all week
Just loosen up and join in the cheer
Cuz now, the band's playing
And we are gonna party down

This is a celebration
All across the nation
Can you feel the vibration
Let's party down

Counteraction rising
Yeah we are ready for the punch line
There's no use with all your gimmicks
SO CHECK THIS OUT!

Login you damned one's
Crush the wont you compromise
The noise comes we are ready to bow
What about the antidote for the jammed and hypnotized
Rend the lie that covers
Who's the real sucker now

咲き乱れた花のように 鮮やかな痛み抱き
佇む街を抜けて 迷いのセリフは捨て
還らない声よ響け
We say Wow Wow Wow Wow

Database Database
Just living in the Database Wow Wow
The wall of pure fiction's cracking in my head
And the addiction of my world still spreads

In the Database Database
I'm struggling in the Database Wow Wow
It doesn't even matter if there is no hope
As the madness of the system grows

Crack in the key for the real clue
Mass redemption reigning on
but we know we've been longing for this
Cut it out The plot that deceived you
Drop the rebel sound Shut the system down
Reveal the never found now

引き裂かれたとしても 虚構とも現実とも
見えるガレキの中で 戦い続けるだけ

Get damn all from big airheads
Yeah You get damn all from big airheads
重なる世界でたぎる心に灯をともして

I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside, oh yeah
Oh, yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide, oh no no
oh no, oh no
Yeah, yeah
I've got a feeling, yeah

Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah yeah oh yeah
And if you leave me, I won't be late again
oh no, oh no, oh no

I've got a feeling, yeah
I've got a feeling

All these years I've been wandering around
wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
who looked like you

I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes
oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling that everybody knows
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I've got a feeling, yeah
Yeah

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sun shine
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down
oh yeah

Everybody had a good year
Everybody had a hard time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sun shine
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down
oh yeah

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling, yeah

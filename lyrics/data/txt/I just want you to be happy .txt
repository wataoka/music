I just want you to be happy
I might not be the one to make you though
It hurts so much to see you down
I just want you to feel better

I just want you to be happy
I might not be the right one, who knows
It hurts so much to see you decay
I just want you to find the way out
I just want you to be happy
You might not feel like talking to me
But it hurts so much to hear the silence
I'd rather hear you scream from your soul

You never tell me what the pain is for
You let your heart be stuck in the fall
You don't have to share
Just come out of a cage
Then the sun will banish your fears

I just want you to be happy
I might not be the one to make you though
It hurts so much just to be around you
When you are too hard on yourself
I just want you to know
I just want you to know
I just want you to know
that it's okay to be happy in the fall

I just want you to be
I just want you to feel
I just want you to be
I just want you to be happy

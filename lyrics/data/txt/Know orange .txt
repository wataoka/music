it was wednesday morning
and standing in the kitchen
with orange in your hand

the wet day in the dark
lit my cigarette, exhale
no orange in my hand

whatever the cause may be
with casual your remark
accept your everything

a little apart from the world
when you spilled sugar on the floor
I pull you close to me

it makes me feel like you're standing there
even if what went through is nothing
can we rewind, it is something.

and see you tonight
watching past many scenes
It's still vivid in my mind
the feeling of you

with you on my side
and lit my cigarette, inhale
It's still vivid in my mind
the feeling of you

will you never ever know?
take your words, just tell me
if you change your mind
and you...
made me realize!

whatever the cause may be
with casual your remark
accept your everything

a little apart from the world
your make up came off
I pulled you close to me

it makes me feel like you're standing there
even if what went through is nothing
can we rewind, it is something.

and see you tonight
watching past many scenes
It's still living in my mind
the feeling of you

with you on my side
and lit my cigarette, inhale
It's still living in my mind
the feeling of you

will you never ever know?
take your words, just tell me
if you change your mind
and you...
just call my name!

will you never ever know?
take your words, just tell me
if you change your mind
and you...
just call my name!

when was it
that I started to draw a line
before I know it,

when was it
that I started to sprit
the dream and reality

I have to go on
take a shower and set myself
to take off to step I have to take
ready or not
here we go

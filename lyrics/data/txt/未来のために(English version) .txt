Life changes so much, in time, with life.
So much that can be done
Makes it harder to see what you left behind
Don't make it so hard than it has to be
The future's right there for us to reach
Don't let it just pass you by
Tell me now baby baby and take my hand
The heart ache is gone. Now we can be one

These feelings are only for you
Look no more girl, here is the place we must go
Together you and I
Reach out far out there high in the sky, Universe

Don't you worry baby a new day will come
I've found you now I won't let you down
Lost and lonely you and I will survive
Our dreams will shine among the stars
Just follow your dreams happiness is
Here to stay I swear you my love
My true love Together we'll be

There's so many memories
That we've been making side by side
Every time I lose my way and I'm down
You take me to that precious moment

The sound of the ocean breeze
Reminds me how we used to be
Something's growin' inside me
I can't explain
Keeps makin' me blue that it makes me cry
But it's you, I know you knew
There were times, It's easier just to let go
We must go work it out. Don't give up
The world is waiting for you, just for you

Don't you worry baby believe in me now
With open arms leave your cares behind
Don't give up now don't you turn me away
Come with me and fly among the stars
I love your sweet smile, I give you my everything.
I swear you my love, my true love.
I'll never let go

Don't you worry baby a new day will come
I've found you now I won't let you down
Lost and lonely you and I will survive
Our dreams will shine among the stars
Just follow your dreams happiness is
Here to stay I swear you my love
My true love Together we'll be

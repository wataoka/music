What you gonna do?
You are in an useless mood
Why don't you follow me?
You're not the one who lives in Town
Screaming and loud like me before

Somehow we stopped being workaholic
everywhere
They have totally no plan
Finally dead end

Have you ever close your eyes?
(Have you ever realize?)
You don't want to hear some words
You can almost feel alive
We'll get to somewhere we want
It might be a frozen place
Have no way to go back again
If I die then we'll be gone forever

Wake up your mind just something in your heart
Anything is right Everything is lies
You must think beyond the lots of meaning
Don't follow just think before you move
Everything is tight Everything is wrong
And I know where we're going to

Have you ever close your eyes?
(Have you ever realize?)
You don't want to hear some words
You can almost feel alive
We'll get to somewhere we want
It might be a frozen place
Have no way to go back again
If I die then we'll be gone forever

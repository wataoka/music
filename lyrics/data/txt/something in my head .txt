There's something warm in my head, in my head
There's something warm in my head, in my head
And it's a feeling of love, and a feeling to take
I can never hide it, you can never find it,
they can never take it away from me
Oh I really like it, I can hardly stand it,
I get nervous comfortably

And it feels so good, hello, goodbye,
Just another phrase, I'll keep it up and start it again
And it feels alright, hello, Goodbye
It's just something in my head
mmm

There's something warm in my head in my head
So lets take a ride, take a ride, look ahead
Lets go to the beach or maybe the mountains today
I can never hide it, you can never find it,
they can never take it away from me
you will really like it, nobody can deny it,
come on get in, ride on with me

And it feels so good, hello, goodbye,
All this speed, oh can you keep it up and start it again?
And it feels alright, hello, Goodbye
It's just something in my head
mmm

And it feels so good, hello, goodbye,
Just another phrase, I'll keep it up and start it again
And it feels so good, hello, goodbye,
All this speed, oh can you keep it up and start it again?
And it feels alright, hello, Goodbye
It's just something in my head
mmm

A nine days' wonder looking back As the sun goes down
As time goes by a sketch of life
On the wall worn out

One day she said in the usual tone
that I don't shine anymore
So I laughed and said "Can you bring it back?"
She stands alone watching the leaves fall

So many places So many ways
But there's no way home Nowhere I belong

So many faces fade away
And then life goes on

So many places So many ways
But there's no way home Nowhere I belong

Off the rails dream away
the amber lights flicker out

an old soldier lives in the dark
stray the light only causes pain

Now I dont't listen to him this time
I packed my bag and I walk to the bus stop
Stars start falling down like a yellow rain, like fire-works
I stand alone watching the stars fall

So many places So many ways But there's no way home Nowhere I belong

So many faces fade away
And then life goes on

Still living in a world we know
Still living in a world we know
hold on there and then life goes on

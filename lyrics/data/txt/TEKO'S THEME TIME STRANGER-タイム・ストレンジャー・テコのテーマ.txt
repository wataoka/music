Here's a song for you
I've waited to sing so long
You are the one, my only love, forevermore
Darlin' take my hand
And take me to Shangri-la
Where there's no hate, where there's no pain,
Where there's no sorrow
It's not the first time
That I've fallen in love with you
Because your smile reminds
Me of the long lost melodies and memories

＊So just keep in your heart
　If you wish and try hard
　Any dream will come true
　That's why we're here together
　I was born to be yours
　You were born to be mine
　And we live in the world
　Where there's no good-bye for good, TEKO!

Here's a song for you
I want you to sing along
I'm on your side, my only love, forevermore
Open up your eyes
We are reaching Shangri-la
Where there's no war, where there's no death
Where there's no darkness
It's not the first time
That you've come back from the past
Because your soul remains
With the man who you really love and care about

＊＊So just keep in your heart
　　If you wish and try hard
　　Any dream will come true
　　That's why we found each other
　　I was born to be yours
　　You were born to be mine
　　And we love in the world
　　Where there's no good-bye for good, TEKO!

＊Repeat

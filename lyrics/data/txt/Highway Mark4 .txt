Go straight
Don't escape
You can make it, do it
Run on the highway, go fast
Don't wait
You're always just rocking by yourself
Run on the highway, go loud

Oh, oh
Strong fellowship
We are the buddies to the paradise

Drive away
We're gonna run to everywhere
Night and day
We never stop
Cause future always spreads ahead

Life's a game
There's no reason to leave yourself
Ride and gain
Cause future is waiting
Whatever you are

Go fight with your might
Colliding and gliding
There we will all find the sound
Sign it and ring it
Go louder and louder
Answer is going to come out

Oh, oh
Strong fellowship
We are the buddies to the paradise

Drive away
We're gonna run to everywhere
Night and day
We never stop
Cause future always spreads ahead

Life's a game
There's no reason to leave yourself
Ride and gain
Cause future is waiting
Whatever you are

I don't care what they say
Don't ever mind
This is my own life
There's nothing to lose

No danger, no future
Challenge yourself
This is your own way
There's a reason to push yourself ahead

Drive away
We're gonna run to everywhere
Night and day
We never stop
Cause future always spreads ahead

Life's a game
There's no reason to leave yourself
Ride and gain
Cause future is waiting
Whatever you are

In my room, In my world, In my dream
Here is my Playground
In my eyes, In my brain, In my heart
These are my Playground

好きなとき 好きなだけ
好きなものに囲まれて
好きなことに埋もれてたい

Love me for me
I want someone to understand me
All about Myself
I want someone to understand me
誰かにいつか気づいて欲しい

In my room, In my world, In my dream
Here is my Playground
In my eyes, In my brain, In my heart
These are my Playground

嫌な事があるたび
気にし過ぎて倒れそう
飽きるまで悩んでいたい

Love me for me
I want someone to understand me
All about Myself
I want someone to understand me
誰かと分かち合っていたいわ

It's you
It's you

Love me for me
I want someone to understand me
All about Myself
I want someone to understand me
Love me for me
I want someone to understand me
誰かに愛されていたいわ

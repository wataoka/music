You and I we're two alone here
And the stairs by the sea
The sun is going down and in your eyes
I see the changing colors of the sea
It's time for you to go
The day is done
And shadows stretch their arms to bring the night
The sun falls in the sea
And down below a window light we see

You and I we're two alone here
In this bar with dimming lights
A full and rising moon comes from the sea
And soon the bar will close for you and me
But there will always be a song to tell a story
You and I can not dismiss
The same old simple story of desire
And suddenly that kiss
That kiss

But there will always be a song to tell a story
You and I can not dismiss
The same old simple story of desire
And suddenly that kiss
That kiss

Don't delete the value to live for by death

感情を掻き乱して君が踊ってる
日々感じる苦痛を吐いて明日を生きれるなら

The only words that I can say to you
―Don't forget the heat that felt here―

脈打つ鼓動 胸に刺して君が嘆き叫ぶ
ヘドロ塗れのその足で此処に孤独を捨てに来ればいい

The only words that I can say to you
―Don't forget the heat that felt here―

Spit out a pain here
Erase a hesitation
聞こえているかい?

To this day

How many times did you think about death?
In the small world
The death doesn't give freedom to you
Even feelings fade away
How many times did you think about death?
In the broken world

If you can believe nothing
Spit out a pain here

The only words that I can say to you
―Don't forget the heat that felt here―

切りつける前に問いかけてみな あがいてまで生きてゆく価値に
明日を断つその無意味さに 誰かが願った明日に―

How many times did you think about death?
In the small world
The death doesn't give freedom to you
Even feelings fade away
How many times did you think about death?
In the broken world
Tomorrow does not disappear
Don't kill yourself

How many times did you think about death?
In the small world
The death doesn't give freedom to you
Even feelings fade away
How many times did you think about death?
In the broken world
Tomorrow does not disappear
Don't kill yourself

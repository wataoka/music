冷え枯れた砂漠のすみに
夕暮れが迫って来れば
独り見上げる空高くなっていく
想い出せない過去からの
数えきれない瑕からの
決別の狼煙がたちのぼる

絡みつく風の冷たさが
夜露を結ぶセイジの葉が
旅発つ刻を示唆してゆらめく

It is a good time to take off.
I gonna go to the happy hunting ground,
When I will be done my own work.
Until that day I always hold it tight in my mind.

I can remember it was Manday morning,
My old man was taking to me.
“Listen,sometimes it is a good day to die.”
Sure,he said so. 

蜘蛛の糸で縫い合わせた
箙を肩に立ち上がる
空にあふれそうな星がつきまとう
侮りがたい未来からの
忘れられない罪からの
決別の兆しが放たれる

交差した矢を信じ続け
交差した矢に応えるため
振り向くことは２度とはないだろう

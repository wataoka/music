Standing where I should be
Believing as I'm told to believe
Being who I should be
Doing what I should do

Did you hear what I said
Did you get what I meant
What you saw is an illusion
You're living in delusion

Going on and on I have the future in my hands
Getting lose from days I never could get over
Going on and on until I'm finally myself
Getting out of this dishonest world I never wanted
Now is the time.
Now is the time.

Ask me if you're anxious
I'll give you all the answers
Truth or dare-it's your choice
Your truth is what you wish for

Who am I to tell you that the future's in your hands?
Set me free from lies and cold deceptions, I'm so scared
Going on and on across this land, across the time
Going on to see, to feel, to breathe
I've always wanted

Sleepless nights I'm spending
Counting all the word that broke my heart
I'm leaving all my past here
Then I'll see the world for sure

Going on and on I have the future in my hands
Getting lose from days I never could get over
Going on and on until I'm finally myself
Getting out of this dishonest world I never wanted

Now is the time.
Now is the time.

Chase after time.
Chase after time.

Squeez'n step on it hard
Try to feel my heart beat
High, as high as you can
All your blood will turn to fountain water

We're surrounded by plot in this universe
Wash away the stain of blood with tears
We cannot look, or they will spell on you
Wind of fuego wil lead us through

I found the light, was real, I am united
I found guide-in line in the raging world
There you see, in the sky, even in this insane world
Ride on Back
All we need is your sympathy
We make the history of our own

I dance blindly in a cage.
She was beaten to the ground.
Streets are filled with lies.
No one knows what's right and what is  wrong.

So you think we are one peaceful nation.
Did you imagine this starvation?
Why we stain the love when we need it.
We are fed up with your opinion.

Stars fall out of the sly, words turned into lies.
Drunk with power, they forced us to hate.
I sacrifice all my life. The evolution was so wrong.
The heart it yearns, for a love that's pure and true.
The palace, it crumbles to the ground.

Yes I can. No I can't. I must go.
Or Should I stay? I cried hard.
Is that me? But no more fears.

Yes I can. No I can't. I must go.
Or Should I stay? I cried hard.
Is that me? Ready go yes!!!

I found the light, was real, I am united
I found guide-in line in the raging world
There you see, in the sky, even in this insane world
Ride on Back
All we need is your sympathy

Stars fall out of the sky, words turned into lies.
Drunk with power,they forced us to hate.
I sacrifice all my life. The evolution was so wrong.
The palace, it crumbles to the ground.

But I want you... see you again.

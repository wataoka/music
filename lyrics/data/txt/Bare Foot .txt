(I don't know what you do here but Iâ€¦)

I don't know who you are
But I caught a sight of you
Hands frozen before a warm dining place

A snowing freezing night
I see you wear no shoes
But you're standing on the street hoping to get high

You with the chapped hands
You look in pain to me and
Your bare feet are now full of cuts

Why don't you buy some shoes
If you can pay for that
All the mess you've been through won't fade away
Why not buy some shoes
You don't need to pay for that
In this town no one cares about you but me

You like to talk on the phone
In the phone box you feel safe
Someone is on the line
But no one touches you

You don't wanna talk about it
So I won't force the issue
I sense an edge when you talk of your childhood

You with the chapped hands
You look in pain to me and
Your bare feet are now full of cuts

Why don't you buy some shoes
If you can pay for that
All the mess you've been through won't fade away
Why not buy some shoes
You don't need to pay for that
No one cares about you but me

Can you get over what they did to you
Your scars won't disappear
But you're still alive
You are still alive

Open your eyes
Look at the world
Break from the nightmare
A whole life awaits you
No one can help you but you

Why don't you buy some shoes
If you can pay for that
All the mess you've been through won't fade away
Why not buy some shoes
You don't need to pay for that
It's cold out no one can help you now but you
But you
But you

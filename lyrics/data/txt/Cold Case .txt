Spending another lonely sleepless night
You've been breathing happily all along
You said your love for me would live as long as you
Crazy in love with you Crazy in love with you

Wide awake, cold blood running through my veins
You've been breathing easily all along
You said your love for me would live as long as you
Madly in love with you Madly in love with you

There was beauty in the sky above,
The sun was lingering for us
Everytime you said that we'd be together I believed
There was just you and me
I caught the sound of your heart beating fast
Everytime you called me, you said "Bring your angel wings"

Spending another lonely sleepless night
You've been breathing happily all along
You said your love for me would live as long as you
Crazy in love with you Crazy in love with you

There were flowers scenting gently,
The wind was blowing through our hair
Everytime you asked me, "Stay by my side eternally"
There was just you and me
I caught the sound of your heart beating fast
Everytime you called me, you said "Bring your angel wings"

I'll be able to sleep well from tonight
Because you breathed your last breath at last
Floating in the nocturne like a dream
I can have still nights You'll have no more nights
I can have still nights You'll have no more nights

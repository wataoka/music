The lonely world
Never cares
It never sees through the dark

Divided from
Happiness
Sealed the smile so it won't hurt

The light maybe blue
But my heart's with you
Is it true
Oh Is it true
Is this where I belong

The only world
I ever knew
It was never warm like this

Deprived of
Happiness
I never knew life as it is

The light is blue
But now my heart is with you
This is true
This is
Where my heart truly belongs

Can you hear the melody
Sing the song to you from my heart
In a sweet slow lullaby
When I look in to your eyes
Maybe you'll never understand
What you truly mean to me
You make me whole
When I'm by your side

Now I know my destiny
Reaching out for you from the dark
Such a sweet little lullaby
How afar I'll know your mine

Now I know the end is near
And the promise is fulfilled
You'll know, you will know
When you truly hear
My voice
Can you hear my voice

The lonely world
Only lies
It never answered to my call

Blinded in
Darkness
Not knowing what love means

The light maybe blue
But my heart is with you
Is it true
Oh Is it true
Is this where I belong

Caught in a swirl
I never cared
I never knew a love like this

Behind the fake
Happiness
I thought my life will end like this

The Light is blue
But now my heart is with you
It is true
It's true
Now my heart truly belongs

Can you hear the melody
I will sing the song from my heart
With my love as your lullaby
I will never leave your side
Maybe you'll never understand
What I truly feel inside
But you make me whole
When I'm by your side

I am touched by my destiny
Hold my hands high up from the dark
Such a sweet little lullaby
When I feel your love inside

After every thing is lost
The promise will remain
You'll know, you will know
When you truly hear
My voice

Can you hear the melody
Sing the song to you from my heart
In a sweet slow lullaby
When I look in to your eyes
Maybe you'll never understand
What you truly mean to me
You make me whole
When I'm by your side

Now I know my destiny
Reaching out for you from the dark
Such a sweet little lullaby
How afar I'll know your mine

Now I know the end is near
And the promise is fulfilled
You'll know, you will know
When you truly hear
My voice
Can you hear my voice

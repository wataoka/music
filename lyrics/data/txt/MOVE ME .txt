When I hear the sound of your voice
I just can't help smiling(Ha…)
And the way you look at me(at me)(Yeah…)
My whole life comes shining
I don't know just why it is, baby
When you are standin' there
I feel the earth start shakin'
And there's thunder in the air

No one ever made me feel so good, baby
Never thought that anybody could

'Cause you move me, really move me
Like nobody could before
Hey, you move me, do it to me
You're the lover I've been waiting for
To move me, come and soothe me
With the moves that I adore
Yeah, you move me, really move me
And you keep me wanting
More and more and more
I love the way you move me Oh…

Just to feel the touch of your hand
My heart feels like dancing
Just a little kiss or two
Magic starts to happen
Everytime you're lovin' me, baby
I can hear angels sing
I'm on my way to heaven
With a brand new pair of wings

Never knew that love could be so good, Oh… yeah
Better than I ever thought it would, oh…

'Cause you move me, really move me
Like nobody could before
Hey, you move me, do it to me
You're the lover I've been waiting for
To move me, come and soothe me
With the moves that I adore
Yeah, you move me, really move me
And you keep me wanting
More and more and more
I love the way you move me

オトナになったから ここに来たよ
もう一度だけ コドモに生まれ変わるため
眠らない街で 眠れなくて にじんだ星を数えれば また朝が来る

Well you made me see the things I could be,
I can reach so high whenever you're by my side
Higher and higher

Love together, you and I we are making harmony
Come together, with a smile sing a sweet melody
Try together 運命も変えられる
Stay forever はじめて知る世界

(Chorus:Live! Together (×3) Sing a song, it won't be long)

Everyday is never the same, always making a change
Wake up to a brand new start, go ahead and just do it,
there's nothing to it

そんな時あなたに会えたこと 運命だと 信じよう

Love together, you and I we are making history
Come together, touch the sky let's defy gravity
Try together, hold your head up high and just believe
Stay forever, in my heart never stop, you and me

(Chorus:Live! Together (×3) Sing a song, it won't be long)(×2)

Love together 誰よりも新しい
Come together あなたを見つめたい
Try together, come alive we can be so happy
Stay forever, don't let go, just hold on to your dream

Love together, you and I we are making history
Come together, touch the sky let's defy gravity
Try together, hold your head up high and just believe
Stay forever, in my heart never stop, you and me

Sometimes I wonder if I'm falling
Only angels know how the life begins

There's a silver lining, so I believe
Feel like drifting on a long twisted stream

The greatest treasures and unknown pleasures
Life is so precious, I wanna make it better

Shining wind in the sky
Look up the sun, now everything's bright
Here's something I never realized
Shining wind in my mind
Full of hope, I've got a feeling inside
Whatever happens, I will survive

No one can find it, my heart's aching
I ask myself why I keep pretending

I am standing alone, the way I feel
I'll take it to the opposite extreme

I am on fire, burning desire
Get over my fear, I wanna fly much higher

Shining wind in the sky
I'm out of tears, I swear I won't cry
One more smile, I'm gonna be alright
Shining wind in my mind
Just go on, anything's worth a try
Whatever happens, I'll be alive

Shining wind in the sky
Look up the sun, now everything's bright
Here's something I never realized
Shining wind in my mind
Full of hope, I've got a feeling inside
Whatever happens, I will survive

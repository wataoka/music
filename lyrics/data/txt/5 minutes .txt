5 minutes to wash my face and 5 minutes to wear my make up
Maybe I'll run out of time today
5 minutes to find my shoes and 5 minutes to run out the door
Maybe I'll run out of time today
And I don't want to think cuz I want to be real,
those things in my head are never real
I don't want to think cuz I want to be real
Tell me to wake up,to wake up,to wake up to you
It's not something you want to say,it'not something you want to see
It's not something you want to do
So give me some clue

5 minutes to drink the milk and 5 minutes to spit it out
maybe I'll run out of time today
5 minutes to find your number 5 minutes to make the call
maybe I'll run out of time today
And I don't want to think cuz I want to be real,
those things in my head are never real
I don't want to think cuz I want to be real
Tell me to wake up,to wake up,to wake up to you
It's not something you want to say,it'not something you want to see
It's not something you want to do
So give me some clue

5 minutes to find my shoes and 5 minutes to run out the door
Maybe I'll run out of time today
5 minutes to my destination 5 minutes I'm on my way
Maybe I'll run out of time today
And I don't want to think cuz I want to be real,
those things in my head are never real
I don't want to think cuz I want to be real
Tell me to wake up,to wake up,to wake up to you
It's not something you want to say,it'not something you want to see
Then it's got to be somewhere you want to go
Anywhere,just let me know 
5 minutes

In the moonlight of the night, standing close holding hands
Wishing the light'll guide us thru, our future yet unknown
Never thought that we, we wud spend the years apart
Memories of the past, thought I'd never be alone

Tears keep falling down my face when I think of u
U were always dear to me, u were always there for me

If I had one wish I'd wish that I could see u again
Can I walk with u and feel ur kisses in the rain ?
If I were to wish again will u be mine alone ?
In this life or in the next, hoping that u feel the same, again...

In your sweet n tender love, all my worries seem to part
Thinkin' of our lives, of the future yet unborn
Every moment spent with u, was a moment of lifetime
U made my heart breathe again, u made me believe in love again

Tears of sorrow till tomorrow thinkin' of u
U were always dear to me, u were always there for me

If I had one wish I'd wish that I could see u again
Can I walk with u and feel ur kisses in the rain?
If I were to wish again will u be mine alone?
In this life or in the next, I just wanna be with u...

Loneliness keep creeping thru my mind
Seeking out the reasons why we had to part
Picking up the pieces of my broken heart
Can u give our love a try, one more time?

Should there be a happy ending to this love affair
Can you keep me close to you and never ever let go...
If I had my way again, u'd be mine forever and always
Wishing for a miracle, I just wanna stay with u
Forever again, if u'll have me baby, oh&amp;#12316;

もしもこの世に一つだけのつぼみを咲かせたならば…
I wanna watch it grow with you

Make me breathe again...

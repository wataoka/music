There ain't no fear
There ain't no hope
There ain't no right
There ain't no wrong

Just make it loud
Just make it loud
Just make it loud
I feel no touch

There ain't no past
There ain't no fate
There ain't no thoughts
There ain't no rules

Spoken words
Broken hearts
Instant dreams

Just let it slide
Wasting time
Just keep it goin' and goin'
Just let it slide
Wasting life
Just keep it rollin' and rollin'
Just make it loud
In your room
Just make it loud
No one cares
And just let it slide

There ain't no pain
There ain't no help
There ain't no doubt
There ain't no name

Just make it fun
Just make it fun
Just make it fun
Carry on

There ain't no hate
There ain't no grace
There ain't no harm
There ain't no truth

Empty bowls
Springer falls
Lost and found

Now I hear it snows
This year is getting colder
How I feel inside
Losing my concentration
Now I need more time
Somehow I'll make it through
I just need more time

Just let it slide
Wasting time
Just keep it goin' and goin'
Just let it slide
Wasting life
Just keep it rollin' and rollin'
Just make it loud
In your room
Just make it loud
No one cares
And just let it slide

Long long way through the sky
Long dark vale where you're standing by
There might be hell that you still ignore
There might be heaven that you're still
Looking for

When your eyes are full of fear
Sweet my baby, what can I do for you?

The rain keeps falling over you
To leave you alone
Please don't hurt yourself anymore
And the rain keeps falling over you
To blame you once more
Please don't hurt yourself
I'll be your shelter

You're always saying
”Where is my angel?”
You're always praying for
Saying your mind
How I wish I were your angel
The voice fades away
And it's lost in my mind

When you're crying with full of fear
Sweet my baby, what should I do for you?

The rain keeps falling over you
To leave you alone
Please don't hurt yourself anymore
And the rain keeps falling over you
To blame you once more
Please don't hurt yourself
I'll be your shelter

Give me your smile
Tear is nor for U

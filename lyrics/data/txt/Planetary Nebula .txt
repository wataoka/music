I remember the day when I first met you.
This rubbish did get a great shock.
In a crowd like a large river I'm able to find
you shine bright number one.

I believed everything was OK.
If you'd be with me you pushed my memory
forward, it's too hard for me
I can't feel your beat 
So be with me.

Destiny be bullying us
I wanna save all of your
crying face, smiling face
sleeping face, so peaceful.
If truth, love and last
last one is there,
we can go together today and tomorrow.

I know that you are the strongest woman.
I see that you are the most delicate girl.
So if you wanna cry you don't have to smile.

How many times did I hurt you.
How many times did I sumile with you.
I wanna fall in love with you.
When I'm born again.
I'm born again.

Destiny be bullying us
I wanna save all of your
crying face, smiling face
sleeping face, so peaceful.
If truth, love and last
last one is there,
we can go together today and tomorrow.

I remember the day when I first met you.
you shine bright number one.

I DON'T WANNA HEAR THE BAD NEWS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A THING
THERE WERE TEARES FALLING DOWN MY CHEEKS, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH, I WASHED MY FACE, I COULDN'T WASH MY SOUL.

I SHOULD OF HOLD ON TO HIM TIGHT
I WANTED TO HOLD HIM BACK, SO, HE WOULDON'T LEAVE

A FROZEN ROSE THAT HAS LOST IT'S LOVE
ONLY THE MEMORIES OF YOU DYE HER IN TO RED
STAYS THERE WAITING TO MELT AWAY
THE PETALS SCATTER LIKE GLASS TEARS

I REALLY I'LL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME
I WANNA BE HOLD SO THIGHT THAT I CAN'T BREATH

SAVE ME FROM MY LONELINESS
IF IT WAS POSSIBLE I SHOULDN'T HAVE MEET YOU

A FROZEN ROSE THAT HAS LOST IT'S LOVE
ONLY THE MEMORIES OF YOU DYE HER IN TO RED
STAYS THERE WAITING TO MELT AWAY
THE PETALS SCATTER LIKE GLASS TEARS

I REALLY I'LL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME

A FROZEN ROSE THAT HAS LOST IT'S LOVE
ONLY THE MEMORIES OF YOU DYE HER IN TO RED
STAYS THERE WAITING TO MELT AWAY
THE PETALS SCATTER LIKE GLASS TEARS

A FROZEN ROSE THAT HAS LOST IT'S LOVE
A FROZEN ROSE THAT HAS LOST IT'S LOVE

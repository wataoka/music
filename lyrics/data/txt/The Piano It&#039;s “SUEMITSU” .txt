I'm having fun
I'm doing such a thing every day and night
It's fine all by myself, I'm alright now
'Cause I feel I'm like you

Still having fun
I'm not changed a bit compared from what I used to be
You let me notice I'm not alone
'Cause you are together with me

Let's play it together forever
A melody of happiness and sadness
It's the sweetest concert in the world

We hope it will reach somewhereâ€¦someday

We will be together
Please forget it not

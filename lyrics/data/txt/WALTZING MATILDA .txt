ONCE A JOLLY SWAGMAN COMPED BY A BILLABOWG
UNDER THE SHADE OF A COOLABAY TREE
AND HE SANG AS HE WATCHED AND HE WAITED
TILL HIS BILLY BOILED
YOU'LL COME A WALTZING MATILDA WITH ME

WALTZING MATILDA, WALTZING MATILDA,
YOU'LL COME A WALTZING MATILDA WITH ME
AND HE SANG AS HE WATCHED AND HE WAITED
TILL HIS BILLY BOILED
YOU'LL COME A WALTZING MATILDA WITH ME

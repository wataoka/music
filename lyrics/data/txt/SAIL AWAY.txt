good bye my empty heart
the ship takes you away, far from me

yes I knew from the start
you were not the one to protect me

between the sky and ground
I can't see any lines that divides us
and it's so beautiful

'cause you don't belong to me
I'll never lose you
now you can fly

you won't see me or my tears
you can sail away free, anywhere

good bye my empty smile
don't tell me how it ends
only time knows

I felt your hand in mine,
but wind tells me to iet you go on

beyond the coldest rain
There must be something I can believe in
slowly, once again

but I'm bleeding inside
oh where should I go?
without you

if I hide in my silence,
you'll never know, I miss you,

between the sky and ground
I can't see any lines that divides us
and it's so beautiful

'cause you don't belong to me
I'll never lose you
now you can fly

just remember this my dear
you can sail away free, anywhere

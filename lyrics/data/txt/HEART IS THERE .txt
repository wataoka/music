Oh! please don't you rock my soul
Cause I don't
want my body to be rocking
I'm telling you that
Don't you rock my soul

When we bend a scary corner
I feel like
I'm gonna give me some good clothes
Make you want yeah!
Your dancing feet!

I'm willing and able
So I throw my notes on your table
Oh! You're right
Talk to right
You never take away
Keep on living you care

To see his heart is there
I don't want to wait
Don't let them fool
Have you ever seen
Many more is open

Love would never leave us
Oh! you know
You should know living in the darkness
We refuse to be
no one can stop them now

We don't want to see you cryin'
and I say
Don't keep on fussing and fighting
You see men sailing on
their ego trips

How could you ever give more
to receive your less, all less
Like my god, let me go
Oh! Rise and take your stance
Now you get, what you want

To see his heart is there
I don't want to wait
Don't let them fool
Have you ever seen
Many more is open

Many door is open

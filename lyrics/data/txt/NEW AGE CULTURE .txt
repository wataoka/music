Time to escape, no time to lose
There's no way to go, for me

笑いなさい 強欲に万歳 Can't sing to your expectation…
Identity Smash & Smash 口先の奴らを

踊りなさい 楽し気にラララ Don't wanna be a pig like you
Identity Smile & Smile Happy & Happy Are you happy?

He's simply a fool with no reason

Symbols of malice swirlin around
You know, money can buy anything

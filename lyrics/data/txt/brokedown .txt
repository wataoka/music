Baby I've been waking up to late for breakfast.
You don't leave me a thing at all,
But I guess that's just the way things go.
I wish that I could get a nice gift for Christmas.
What did I get last year? I don't recall.
Oh don't you love me anymore?
I don't think that I could cry.
Can't admit that we're a lie,
Someone save me from this broken, soakin' lost motivation
Don't you know me anymore?
All those chitchats lying down, what happened?
I guess we just broke down.

I don't think that I could cry,
Can't admit that we're a lie,
Someone save me from this broken, soakin' lost motivation
Don't you know me anymore?
All those chitchats lying down, what happened?

Now this is why I tried so hard to make it happen.
Can I ask why you always broke me up in tears?
We said goodbye, if only time could heal everything.
I wish that I could trust everything you say.

Now this is why I tried so hard to make it happen.
Can I ask why you always broke me up in tears?
We said goodbye, if only time could heal everything.
I wish that I could cause I'm broken down.

How does the heart change? It's strange.
I am caught up in a world with no stage,
But my pages still turn, with an uneasy, teasy
ending with only one image.
As strange as it is, everything ain't how it appears,
I'm rollin' rollin' rollin' strollin'
Wish that I could move it on,
but maybe I've been hanging on too long.
My reasons seems to be a sad song written by a happy person...
Write on and on...

I don't think that I could cry,
Can't admit that we're a lie,
Someone save me from this broken, soakin' lost motivation
Don't you know me anymore?
All those chitchats lying down, what happened?

Now this is why I tried so hard to make it happen.
Can I ask why you always broke me up in tears?
We said goodbye, if only time could heal everything.
I wish that I could trust everything you say.

Now this is why I tried so hard to make it happen.
Can I ask why you always broke me up in tears?
We said goodbye, if only time could heal everything.
I wish that I could cause I'm broken down.

There's a way!

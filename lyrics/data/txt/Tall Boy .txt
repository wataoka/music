tears and rains are everywhere I go
I'm tired of this weather long ago
twenty thousand yen to go
to get a ticket for a next goal

oh boy, I lost another game
It's all the same
I hear your fame

maybe, it's just a game
but it's not the same
I'll kill your fame

maybe he is decieving maybe I should grab the money and run...
cause today is the day if I say so
today is the day if I try so

tall boy, what can you see from there?
tell me exactly what you see
oh boy, don't show your back too long
feel's like I wanna star a game again...

today is the day if I say so
today is the day if I try so
today is the day today is the day

today is the day if I say so
whenever is the time if you do so...if you do so

Look at me, what do you see? 
Am I real or just a dream? 
Am I something that you need? 
Or just an image of me? 

And if you stare into the fire too long 
Is the flame as strong? 
Or if you're lost inside a fantasy 
Does it end up real? 

So if you think that you're in love with me 
Or is it just the whole idea 
You must be sure that every single thing 
Is what you believe in. 

Look at me, what do you see? 
Am I real or just a dream? 
Am I something that you need? 
Or just an image of me? 

Look at me, what do you see? 
Am I real or just a dream? 
Am I something that you need? 
Or just an image of me? 

If every drop of rain stayed in the sky 
Would the world just die? 
Or earth revolved around a different sun 
Would our life have begun? 

So if you think that you're in love with me 
Tell me can you still be free? 
For on the surface of most everything 
Something hides within. 

Look at me, what do you see? 
Am I real or just a dream? 
Am I something that you need? 
Or just an image of me? 

Look at me, what do you see? 
Am I real or just a dream? 
Am I something that you need? 
Or just an image of me?

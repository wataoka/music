朝焼けの一秒前に見上げた
滲んだ星を思い出す度

心の奥に隠してきた
貴方の声が

離さないように 繋いだメロディー
流星の風に吹かれながら

追い掛けていた 美しかった
夜の果てに消えた

Why did you say goodbye?
I broke down under the rain.
Why did you say goodbye?
I broke down under the rain.
Why did you say goodbye?
It'd wash away my stinging pain.
I still can't be free from this place.
Trees and wind stand still in this rain.

綺麗だった白い銀河
追い掛けて手を伸ばしても
届かなかった 音も無かった
全てが儚く思えて

貴方がいて 笑ってくれて
それだけで心が満たされて

そして幻に消えて

Why did you say goodbye?
I broke down under the rain.
Why did you say goodbye?
I broke down under the rain.
Why did you say goodbye?
It'd wash away my stinging pain.
I still can't be free from this place.
Trees and wind stand still in this rain.

無くした小さなメロディー
夜空に響いて

You taught that things disappear entirely.
And things stay in the heart entirely.
You taught that to me in this rain.

Why did you say goodbye?
I broke down under the rain.
Why did you say goodbye?
I broke down under the rain.
Why did you say goodbye?
It'd wash away my stinging pain.
I still can't be free from this place.
Trees and wind stand still in this rain.

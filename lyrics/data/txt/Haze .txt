Oh yeah, that's the static that I dance around in
Oh yeah, that's the haze I wanna keep around me

Solitude, it cuts me deep when I don't know just how I'm feeling
If you were there then I would mend and I could better understand that riddle
Red, red, the color that I keep sending to call you out
But I don't know, I don't know...

So tell me if you're just a vision
A cloudy mix of hidden meanings
If you appear and disappear then I can never get to know that riddle
Red, red, the color that I keep sending to call you out
But I don't know, I don't know if you are there

Medicate my heart and steer it in
Let you take your aim at me within

So baby hit that mark in me, mark in me
I'll let you take a hold of me
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)
So baby hit that mark in me, mark in me
I'll let you take a hold of me
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)

She gonna be the one that makes me believe again
She gonna be the one that makes me see again
She gonna be the one that makes me real again
She gonna be the one that makes me hum again
She gonna be the one that makes me feel again
She gonna be the one that makes me understand

So baby hit that mark in me, mark in me
I'll let you take a hold of me
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)
So baby hit that mark in me, mark in me
I'll let you take a hold of me
She gonna be...(Distort and come out)
She gonna be...arriving here for me

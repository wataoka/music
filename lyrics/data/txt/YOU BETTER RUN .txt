What you tryin' to do to my heart
What you tryin' to do to my heart
You go around tellin' lies
Foolin' round with other guys
What you tryin' to do to my heart

You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my sight

What you tryin' to do to my soul
What you tryin' to do to my soul
Everything I had was yours
Now I'm closin' all the doors
What you tryin' to do to my soul

You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my sight

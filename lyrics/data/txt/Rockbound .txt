Freezing day, freezing air 街に溢れるcrime of fraud
Confuse, sadness 立ち止まるな
Your wish broke down 街を埋めゆくhypocrite
Scan it! Kick it out! かいくぐれ
Frozen rain, frozen heart よく似た顔のdoomsayer
Goddamn! Feel sick! 打ち破れ

Oh 繰り返すunbroken cell, unbroken will
Oh はい上がれ、闇を渡りきれ!

You're the fire, you're the flame
Rock bounded ways
Face your spirit, face your mind
Rock bounded ways
No turning back, no give it up
Rock bounded ways
走りゆけ

Walking, seeking, needing
Running, searching, touching
Rolling, flying, burning
Stay for your life!!

Should we go or stay? 明日に焦がれるblood streak
Don't think! Go ahead!
Never surrender

Oh 繰り返すunbroken cell, unbroken will
Oh はい上がれ、闇を渡りきれ!

Rock bound
Rock bounded ways

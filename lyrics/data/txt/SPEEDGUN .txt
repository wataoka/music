I'M STANDING THERE
HE'S STARING FROM THE TOWER TOP

I DON'T FOLLOW
I'M NOT SCARED OF THE SHADOW OF THE DEAMON
I DON'T FOLLOW
CUZ I'M A SCION OF SPEEDGUN

I'M BURIED ALIVE
HE'S HEARING ON THE RUBBLE PILES

I DON'T FOLLOW
I'M NOT SCARED OF THE SHADOW OF THE DEAMON
I DON'T FOLLOW
CUZ I'M A SCION OF SPEEDGUN

summer rain falls on the apple branches
lights from heaven dancing with the shadows

come take my hand
let me be in your forest

sometimes you think loneliness is better than pain
and you sink deeper in your valley

is this the place to be, in your memory?

no, I never wanna lose you in the forest of the night
in vanity's lair
yearning for the angel calling
hear the lonely prayer ringing through the land of rain
across the thin air
they sing voice to voice
the ancient melodies
calling you

autumn goes by
combing twilight into my hair
I look back on the passing tenderness

let me stay by your side
in your memory

no, you never gonna find me in the forest of the night
in vanity's lair
no more holly angel calling
hear my lonely prayer ringing through the land of rain
across the thin air
we sing voice to voice
the ancient melodies
I'm calling you

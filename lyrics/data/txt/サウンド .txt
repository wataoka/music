Can you hear now? Can you hear my voice now?
I sound your favorite sounds.
Listen to this music.
I play for your good smile.

You will get tired if you walk for a long time.
Fall over…Get damaged…No! Don't worry!

Sad thing. Bad news. Looking down.
Turn to a front.

Can you hear now? Can you hear my voice now?
I sound your favorite sounds.
Listen to this music.
I play for your good smile.

You have the feeling of believing.
Stand up! You are not a weakling.

Sad thing. Bad news. Looking down.
No No No. Turn to a front.

Can you hear now? Can you hear my voice now?
I sound your favorite sounds.

Listen to this music.
I play for your good smile.

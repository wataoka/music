Deep brown eyes
They make me weak
No need to speak
Now it's you & I
Take me up
Up to the sky
Kid you make me high
How I longed your touch

Can you make my dreams come true
Cause I'll be with you... Whenever
Promise to you... Till forever

Baby I
I feel complete
When you're with me
That's how its gotta be
Whisper softly
Into my ears
So I can hear
That you really love me

Can you make my dreams come true
Cause I'll be with you...Whenever
Promise to you... Till forever
Wanna be the one in your life
To be by your side... For you
With nothing to hide... From you

Don't hold back no more
Cause I'm needing you now
Ever since my life had merged with yours
Gave me butterflies
Kept on blowin' my mind
What do these emotions mean?
Can you help me?

Be my light
Hold me tight

Always with you
You know that it's true
Together with you
All my life

Can you make my dreams come true
Cause I'll be with you...Whenever
Promise to you... Till forever
Wanna be the one in your life
To be by your side... For you
With nothing to hide... From you

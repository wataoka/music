far in the light, I can see it
in every scene of the night
a tiny feather of love

I gotta go
destiny never finds the way for me, my love

even in the night I see your face, in the dark
so I never lose my way to you
I never close my heart
the light is always there

time goes by, we can never stay the same
now we've come so far from love memory
though your smile has gone, we will never be apart
in our hearts we are one, for love melody
the future arrives with your love

willing to go to the place
where you never need to cry
I'll take you there

willing to find an answer
in all the winding road we have come through

in the heat of the summer, cold of winter, I'm here
so you never lose your way to me
never close your heart
your light is always here

time goes by, we can never stay the same
in the shades of hope, in love memory
though your smile has gone, we will never be apart
in our hearts we can hear the love melody
the future still shines, close to you

・Hock
do the impossible
see the invisible
raw! raw!
fight the power!

touch the untouchable
break the unbreakable
raw! raw!
fight the power!

what you gonna do is what you wanna do
just break the rule, then you see the truth
this is the theme of "G"coming through baby!
raw! raw!
fight the power!

・Verse1
power to the peeps, power for the dream
still missing piece scatterning, so incomplete
we be the most incredible soldier from undergraound
see how easy, they all fall down
digging to the core to see the light
Let's get out of there babe, that's the way to survive
top of the head, I'm on the set
do the impossible, don't you wanna bet?
cuz, a lot of things changed, we be waiting in vain
if you wanna get by, no pain no gain
wow! fakers wanna test me again
(damn! suckers wanna test me again)
sorry, my rhyme's gonna snatch your brain
we gonna make it happen with the crazy rap
(I'm still starving for the straight up shit)
we gonna make it happen with the crazy rap skill(shit)
get ready to ramble, now is the time
if you don't know, now you know

(good luck fellows! ha ha)

・Verse2
2nd verse dedicates to the real peeps
what we got to say is so real thing
(What we got to say is damn real thing)
cuz, revolution ain't never gonna televise
kickin the mad flow, microphone phenotype
(kicking the dpe shit, microphone phenotype)
open your third eye, seeing through the overground
I'm about to hit you with the scream from the underground
whole city is covered with the cyber flavor
"G"is in your area, one of the toughest enigma

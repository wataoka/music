Look, look me up and down
You would be forgiven if I had a taste
You, see everything you're missing now
Oh I'd hate to see this moment go to waste

I don't really care if you're not single
We could use each other just a little
No one has to know if we're together
Come on let me be your guilty pleasure

Hide, hide every rule we break
Just close your eyes we could be done in record time
No, no is not a word you'll say
I know you won't resist the secret kiss of mine

I don't really care if you're not single
We could use each other just a little
No one has to know if we're together
Come on let me be your guilty pleasure
Everything could change in just a minute
But there's nobody else when we're in it
We don't have to talk about forever
Come on let me be your guilty pleasure

Nothings better than the tension killing me
Who says that this is not, what it's supposed to be

I don't really care if you're not single
We could use each other just a little
No one has to know if we're together
Come on let me be your guilty pleasure
Everything could change in just a minute
But there's nobody else when we're in it
We don't have to talk about forever
Come on let me be your guilty pleasure

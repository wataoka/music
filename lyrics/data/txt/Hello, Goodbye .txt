You say yes, I say no,
You say stop, and I say go, go, go,
Oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello,
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello,
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

I say high, you say low,
You say why, and I say I don't know.
Oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello,
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

Why, why, why, why, why, why,
Do you say goodbye.
Oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello,
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello.

You say yes, I say no,
You say stop and I say go, go, go.
Oh, oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello, hello, hello.
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello,
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello,
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, hello, hello,

Never knowing what comes of life
imagining the gift of love with you
and tonight my day ended with a lie
another lonely night alone,
when I turn around.

Better love is ahead I pray
It's still so hard to spend my night each day.
Oh, I wish you knew. Ahh, This pain inside
I wonder why it's still the same
When I turn around

And It's still so hard to stay.
I pray to see your eyes
and feel the love you gave me
I swear I think of you
I cry all through the night.
But I believe in prayers.
I know some how one day
you'll come my way
I want you in my life

Never alone, where ever you go
What ever will come what may no other way
and I give my endless love to you

And It's still so hard to stay.
I pray to see your eyes
and feel the love you gave me
I swear I think of you
I cry all through the night.
But I believe in prayers.
I know some how one day
you'll come my way
I want you in my life

I'll find my way to you
close to your heart then never let go
remember the love we knew someday you'll know
Oh, the meaning of my life is you

His ship was Nexus one
Made from titanium
Red, white and blue flowing proud in it's veins
He was the chosen one with hopes he'd get it done
The world was watching on the day that he left
It was a big show
Light up and lift off
Sending signals through the smoke that was rising
The crowd went wild as he took to the sky
Nobody doubted that he'd come back alive

I'm calling to the man in the sky
I'm calling to the man, won't you call back
I'm calling to the man in the sky
I'm calling to the man, won't you call back to your world

But then with Vesta in sight
A sudden flash of light
Something hit him and it spun him around
All of the power was lost
His heart was beating so fast
Alone with nothing but the thoughts in his head
No way to get home
No place to land on
His broken ship just kept on drifting away
In time the people here forgot he was there
Over and out...over and out...

I'm calling to the man in the sky
I'm calling to the man, won't you call back
I'm calling to the man in the sky
I'm calling to the man, but the call back never came

Don't you wanna come home?
Don't you wanna come home?
I know you wanna come home

Oh can't you see?
He's overhead
Over there!

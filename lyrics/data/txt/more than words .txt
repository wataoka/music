Saying 'I love you' is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you not to say
but if you only knew

How easy it would be to show me how you feel
more than words is all you have to do to make it real
then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'cause I'd already know

What would you do?
If my heart was torn in two
more than words to show you feel that your love for me is real

What would you say?
If I look those words away
then you couldn't make thing new, just by saying 'I love you'
more than words

Now that I've tried to talk to you
and make you understand
all you have to do is close your eyes
and just reach out your hands

and touch me
hold me close
don't ever let me go
more than words is all I ever needed you to show
then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'cause I'd already know

What would you do?
If my heart was torn in two
more than words to show you feel that your love for me is real

What would you say?
If I took those words away
then you couldn't make thing new, just by saying 'I love you'
more than words...

I love you baby...
Close your eyes...
Please baby, I love you baby...
Don't ever let me go...

Close your eyes...
Please baby, my baby...
more than words...

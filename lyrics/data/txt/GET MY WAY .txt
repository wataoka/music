You surely said to me "follow me"
That's your favorite saying with tricks.
What a haughty word. Don't put on air.
Do you want me to believe you? That's funny.

What can I do? What can I believe?
The world is filled with unfair things.
How can I do? Why can I believe?
I'm sure nobody tries to hear me.

Stay away from me,
oh don't touch me
I don't want to show you myself
And I don't want you to control my wayâ€¦
Yeah, I gotta get my way.

Hey, I know that dumbs around you say
You're such a great guy. Popular, handsome, and rich.
Do you say what they say is right?
Doesn't matter, I hate you anyway. That is all.

What can I do? What can I believe?
The world is filled with unfair things.
How can I do? Why can I believe?
I'm sure nobody tries to hear me.

Stay away from me,
oh don't touch me
I don't want to show you myself
And I don't want you to control my mind.
Stay away from my everything.
I don't want to show you myself
And I don't want you to control my way.

Yeah, I gotta get my way.

Yeah, that's right, you are right. I'm still green. And I'm still a child.
Can you take me? Can you tell me? The right way to live.
But I know who you are. Did you think that I really believe you?
Get away. Get away from me.

Stay away from me.
Oh don't touch me
I don't want to show you myself
And I don't want you to control my mind.
Stay away from my everything.
I don't want to show you myself
And I don't want you to control my way.
Yeah, I gotta get my way.

Heat of the night
They just can't resist your love
In the heat of the night
They'll just come and get your love
Don't waste your time and come to me now, oh no
I'm moving on, so long

Bright city lights
Can hide the darkness of your face
Yeah, those bright city lights
Can hide the scars right on your face
Don't waste your time 'cuz I can see now, oh no
I'm moving on, so long

You try to get away
But something makes you stay
The temperature is rising
Feel your body hot and burning
Got to get away
You've got to get away
But something makes you hang on

Oh, night time city, some things just ain't pretty
In the city, you're blinded you can't see
Nighttime city, you've got to stay steady
In the city, just hold on baby

Heat of the night
They just can't resist your love
In the heat of the night
They'll just come and get your love
Don't waste your time and come to me now, oh no
I'm moving on, so long

You try to get away
But something makes you stay
The temperature is rising
Feel your body hot and burning
Got to get away
You've got to get away
But something makes you hold on

Oh, night time city, some things just ain't pretty
In the city, you're blinded you can't see
Nighttime city, you've got to stay steady
In the city, just hold on baby

You try to get away
But something makes you stay
The temperature is rising
Feel your body hot and burning
Got to get away
You've got to get away
But something makes you hold on

Oh, night time city, some things just ain't pretty
In the city, you're blinded you can't see
Nighttime city, you've got to stay steady
In the city, just hold on baby

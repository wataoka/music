Feel like a fiction
Oh 揺らいだ moment
How many questions?
答えはいつも unstable
この夢は real?
曖昧にするわ Sunday
But, it's alright

Smile to me, baby
You and I そう二人の secret
Won't you smile to me, baby?
君の瞳の rainbow

Just like the sun in the sky
Just like the moon in the dark
You and I, we can be
Just shining on, shining on
Shining on, shining on
君と shining on
Shining on

Isolation
Oh 塞いでる feeling
Simple solution
答えはいつも on the table
この夢は still
永遠に抱くわ sunrise
Yes, it's alright

Smile to me, baby
You and I そう愛の portrait
Won't you smile to me, baby?
君と描く tomorrow

Just like the birds in flight
Just like the stars in the dark
You and I, we can be
Just shining on, shining on
Shining on, shining on
君と shining on
Shining on

Smile to me, baby
You and I そう二人の secret
Won't you smile to me, baby?
君の瞳の rainbow
溢れ出す tomorrow
Yes, we can be

Just like the sun in the sky
Just like the moon in the dark
You and I, we can be
Just shining on, shining on

Just like the birds in flight
Just like the stars in the dark
You and I, we can be
Just shining on, shining on
Shining on, shining on
君と shining on
Shining on

When I called your name, the world began
Shining on eternally

I noticed the sound and heard a voice
And I was saved many times

Crystallized, we were as one
We wandered and met again
All this time, all these things were written for a billion years

Tell me about yourself
Because the world will be over
Tell me about yourself
Because the truth can't be found

There were many wars, sparks they danced
We pretended not to see

We were too ignorant and too powerless

Tell me about your song
Tell me about your star
Tell me about your sins
Tell me about your name
Tell me about yourself
Hurry

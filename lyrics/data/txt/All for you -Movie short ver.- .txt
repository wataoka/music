Every time when I try to get better
I make the same mistake again
And Looking for what...
didn't know what I what oh
Just going around and around
But then you came into my life
And truned my life around
I never felt so special
And now I know the reason why
When I saw you I had to stop by
That's long ago
We still have a same goal

All my love
All my life
I will stand be your side
All my strength
all ny heart
I'll give you anything
I can hear in my heart
When I was in the dark
You showed me where I'm supposed to go
いつも今もこの先ずっと
キミと時を越えてくでしょ
どんなことからも守るから
たとえ何かを失ったとしても….

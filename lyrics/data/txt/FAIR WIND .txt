My baby you don't know
how much I love you behind of you
Cause (you) always look (at) the front
to get your dream in future
My baby you don't know
whether you meet with an accident
It's (a) lonely like a bird
But it's a really free like (a) bird

I know I just a fair wind, it's OK
You can go to everywhere
I believe my love and believe your love
Go across ocean and blue sky

Baby don't be afraid
If you try to fly away
with a tiny shiny wing, I'll be follow(ing) you
everyday and overnight
Baby don't be afraid
If you stay by breaking heart
through the lonely shady night
I'll be hug your pain
wherever and forever

My baby keep in mind
how much I love you beside of you
This way is hard like hill
but it's a really sweet like (a) kiss

I know I just a fair wind, it's OK
You can go to everywhere
I believe my soul and believe your soul
Go catch exciting chance and dream

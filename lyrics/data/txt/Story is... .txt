I fed up with same all day.
I feel this pain rust forever.
I need some changes in my life.
Loosing the way for tomorrow...
looking for direction then I see no signs are on my glory way.

can't find the way... can't find the way...
can't find the way... can't find the way...
can't find the way... I hit the road to fame
can't find the way... can't find the way...
Yes I got to straggle 'till I die.
Now I know only I can change myself

Walk in the dark. In silent night.
All I can see is black and blue
Someday its rain. Someday its snow.
But one day, sun will burn and shine on me

can't find the way... can't find the way...
can't find the way... can't find the way...
can't find the way... I hit the road to fame
can't find the way... can't find the way...
Yes I got to straggle 'till I die.
Now I know only I can change myself

Now I know only I can change myself
Now I know only I can change myself
Now I know only I can change my way.

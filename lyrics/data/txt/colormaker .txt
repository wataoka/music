I wonder why you look so awful today
Everything you say is blaming and complaining
Maybe I could handle them
but just please zip your mouth for a moment

How about to shut your brain off in your tiny little head
or maybe we can just hang out
or drop by at my friend's place to get something nice for brunch
It doesn't matter if the sky is cloudy and the sun is pale

Let me brighten your day
all you have to do is just tell me your favorite colors
pink or green, yellow and blue
it'll be so bright and so nice

Our world should be lovable
but sometimes it might be a little too much
to gaze so many beautiful colors
Red, orange, purple and gold
It'll be so bright but so nice

iro tori dori no hana taba wo kimi ni agetai
iro tori dori no hana taba de sekai wo someyou

I wonder since when we've been made a distance between us
Everything seemed OK to me, but I was wrong
Let's just shut it down or maybe it's better to restart
'cause our memories might be gone away

How about to make an appointment with our smartest doctors
or maybe we can just fight out
then I'll take you to a movie and take you out to dinner
it doesn't matter if the storm is coming or the sun is gone

Let me change your day
all you have to do is just tell me your favorite colors
pink or green, yellow and blue
it'll be so bright and so nice

Our world should be lovable
but sometimes it might be a little to much
to gaze so many beautiful colors
Red, orange, purple and gold
It'll be so bright but so nice

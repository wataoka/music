You are the reason that fills me
You are the meaning that gives me hope
アナタがいたから

All we ever knew was lost
Devastated plans we made
The ghost of your laughter haunting my dreams
無くした記憶は
戻らないけど
零した涙の数だけ強くなれる

You are the reason that feels me
You are the meaning that gives me hope
アナタがいたから
まだ一人じゃ何も出来ないけど

You are the reason that I live for

You are the reason that feels me
You are the meaning that gives me hope
アナタがいたから

You are the reason that I live for...

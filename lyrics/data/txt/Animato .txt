Somebody out there better get this
Not many people can do it like this
How about some speakers to amplify me
How about a rhyme to fortify me
Life's messy so I clarify it
Simplifying things for everybody
(Chorus)
I need someone who's true
Someone who does the laundry too
So what you gonna do
Please don't forget to follow-through
I take my diamond shoes
Someone who tries to be on time
Do what you said you'll do
I hope you like to follow-through
All that I need's a bit o' practice
My mind is set on bigger business
This is not a time for reminiscing
This is something new and interesting
Why are you trying to classify it
This is music for all humanity from me
Dreaming of hip hop tunes
They say you've got the proper tools
So what you gonna do
Keep doing things the way you do
I take my diamond shoes
Someone who tries to be on time
Do what you came to do
I came to see you follow-through
Chorus

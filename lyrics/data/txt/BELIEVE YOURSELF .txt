夜に日を次ぐような毎日も
いつか実を結ぶから
闇雲でももがいてもいい
立ち止まらず進もう

思考回路
君だけが持つオリジナル
ヒトモドキの殻を破るための力になる

かりそめの街でクモの糸を上るよ

believe yourself
つまずいて
くじけそうな君にこのメロディ
夢の場所遠い
でも見つけたのなら
素晴らしいんだよ

Each path thats there are never identical
Do you want to keep being a slave?
Adore and hate you might be carrying, but no one except you can be you

What others say isn't correct
It is you who could decide whats best
You might feel isolated
It may be harsh but do not ever lose yourself
Come now

Sunny days
Rainy days
Weather all change
Someday friends will leave
You have to say good-bye but what you have to do will stay unchanged no matter what

Present(and)past
occasion have had changes
Hold on tight to things you don't want to say good-bye
Remember who you and what you are

ひとすじ落ちた
雫が暖かくしみ込む
夕べの雨が嘘みたいだなと笑う

Believe Yourself
悲しみも
絶望も乗り越えられるように
駆け巡る
想い
ありったけ集めて
今歌うよ

I'll sing this song for you
Song that will keep us in touch
Everlasting song that won't be lost
I'll summon up my courage so that you can hear me call you from anywhere and anytime

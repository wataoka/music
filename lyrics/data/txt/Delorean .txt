Where're we heading to?
(Just) wanna sit back
and relax on a mistyroad
But by the time, at became usual
and we got used to it
And finally got used to
Dear Mr. Driver I know
you'll give your best drive around
but don't use the short cut
This time wanna enjoy
everything the comes into the sight
Waste up the tires for me

Keep driving crazy!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Keep this insane drive!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Long strait drive would be easy
but soon would be fed up

Can I him when I make a turn here?
Wanna hold your hands
and make the promise
The morning that pray for happiness
By the time, it became usual Dear Mr.
Driver, another's fault caus' you to crush
It wasn't your fault
But it feels good to be alive
It's telling you to go on
faster on your way
Waste up the tires for me

Keep driving crazy!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Keep this insane drive!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Long strait drive would be easy
but soon would be fed up

Keep driving crazy!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Keep this insane drive!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Hitting hardly the bump

It's up to you
Before the tires go flat
Let's pick up somebody we wanna see

Keep driving crazy!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Keep this insane drive!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Long strait drive would be easy
but soon would be fed up

Keep driving crazy!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Keep this insane drive!
(Just keep on rollin rollin)
Hitting hardly the bump
take it for real!?
It's up to you
For real it's up to you
Of keep driving crazy!

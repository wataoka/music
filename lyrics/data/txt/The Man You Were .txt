On time, you never came
You didn't leave a note
Expected me to mindread
I cry. I pay another bill
Enough to make me sick but I won't let you
"ooh, would it make it better if I left you"
"oh, no. I'm not up for thus again tonight"

I wonder where the man you were is anymore
I don't know what to think of you anymore
Instead of thought I shy away from it
'Cause I never wanted it this way
No I never wanted it this way

You know that, I don't know what to think
'Cause you're making me think it's alright
And all that had held us up, is nearly gone
And I'm about to fall off now

When you're lost in thought you might forget
Your will to fight a weak heart becomes less and less
Get your pride back,(you)need to pursue
Forward not rewind

I wonder where the man you were is anymore
I don't know what to think of you anymore
Instead of thought I shy away from it
'Cause I never wanted it this way
No I never wanted it this way

'Cause I never wanted to know
Pretended it was all a bad dream
But now that I'm waking up
I know that it won't be the same
Maybe another time
We might have had a chance together
Now I stand all alone without you.

(Find it who that)
(Mercy who that sayin' mercy?)
So hot'n'nasty
Hey Joe, don't forget to shake it
While you sleepin' on that bed
You know it really makes it
Look at me shake a leg

I got my head in a cloud
I'm gonna stand up and shout
I wanna sing out loud
Oh, got to do it with the feelin'
Now you gonna hit the ceiling
Do you get the message? (×3)

Hey, boogaloo, I really love you
Look what you've done to my head
Take all my time
Take all my money

But most of all you take all my bed

I get my head in a cloud
I wanna sing it loud
I'm gonna stand right here and shout
You got to do it with the feelin'
Well, you gonna hit the ceiling
Do you get the message?

(Don't for get to shake that thing…)

Do you get the feelin'?
Then you gonna hit the ceiling
Hot'n'nasty, hot'n'nasty
It's hot'n'nasty, so hot'n'nasty etc

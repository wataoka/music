I said I'm feeling all right baby down home blues
Take me down to the sweet home town, Take me home
I'm gonna leave it right now, That's right, Get down blues
I said I'm talking about a down home blues
Do it baby all night long, like a rollin stone
I said it feel so good baby the blues is Home Town Blues

Home Town Blues Home Town Blues
Home Town Blues Home Town Blues

I said I'm feeling all right baby down home blues.
Take me down to the sweet home town, Take me home
I'm gonna leave it right now, That's right, Get down blues

Do it baby all night long, like a rollin stone
I said it feel so good baby the blues is Home Town Blues

I said I'm talking about a down home blues
Do it baby all night long, like a rollin stone

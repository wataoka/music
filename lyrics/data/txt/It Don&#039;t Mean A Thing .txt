What good is melody
What good is music
If it ain't possessing something sweet

It ain't the melody
It ain't the music
Theres something else that makes that tune complete

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wab
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wah

It don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wab
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wah

Makes no difference if it's sweet or hard
You just give that rhythm everything you got

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wab
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wah

Makes no difference if it's sweet or hard
You just give that rhythm everything you got

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wab
doo-wab-di-wab doo-wab-di-wah

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing

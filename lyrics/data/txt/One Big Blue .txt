You gotta wake yourself up all right?
I think you do know.
While it can seem so hard now, that's broken yourself.

Even though you lost & cry, gotta take in what's goin' on.
Round round…come around round…
You grieving it over, don't mess up your day.

All of feeling I got so far will never come true of every dreaming.
What is lost can still be found when you stand here on the ground.

Hey you, still waiting for your something?
I'm here with you.
When no one seems to care, you gotta hang on so strong.

Do you feel all my pain?
I can be your papan angel.
I swear…swear…
Blow this life to hell, grab and drag just take me home.

All of feeling I got so far will never come true of every dreaming.
What is lost can still be found when you stand here on the ground.

All of feeling I got so far will never come true of every dreaming.
The weeping drops like a rain fills up river toward one blue.

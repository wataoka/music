I tried to wake up yesterday,
Forgetting yesterday was Sunday,
I don't think I need a hand,
Come to think, maybe I...
Do you mind? Our time is half the same.

(Monday) I try to speak up, but I don't.
You make the effort, but I won't.
(Tuesday) I'm the guy who plays that part in that old movie.
I'm without inspiration
If I can make the man proud...
Understand it's not easy but I guess I'll just keep moving on.

Maybe I won't try any better.
Baby you never had to leave me.
Thought you were somebody eles.
I'm glad I left you.

I know it's hard to get away when all you know is here...I'm here.

(Wednesday) May 10th, I never really had a voice back then.
I'll try to sing a little once again, but in the end, I'll fail to pay the rent.
(Thursday) I'm fine, just never knew that I was running out of time.
Ya see that? When the boat sails on, and you're left along the wave that drags you in.
I don't want to be alone.

Maybe I won't try any better.
Baby you never had to leave me.
Thought you were somebody eles.
I'm glad I left you.

Friday, I don't think I can begin again.
Pausing my life? What would I do then?
It's not that easy, but I'll never know unless I try.
Oh! Somebody help me stop the hands of time.
I know it sounds crazy but maybe the only way out is to win the lottery.
I'll keep on dreaming yeah.

Maybe I won't try any better.
Baby you never had to leave me.
Thought you were somebody eles.
I'm glad I left you.

Maybe I won't try any better.
Baby you never had to leave me.
Thought you were somebody eles.
I'm glad I left you.

I've seen you before
In the back of my memory
I looked in your eyes
And felt the truth in me

You're finally here
Been waiting so long
You took my hand
And told me to believe

Now I know that you are the answers to my prayers and
You are my warmth and my strength, I'm not afraid now
Time will soon embrace our bound destiny
I'll spread my wings and fly to where I belong
This is our journey

You picked me up
From the shadows of pain
How was I to know
That I would love again

So I know that often our minds maybe misleading
But my heart is not willing to stop. I feel it burning
Time will soon embrace our bound destiny
I'll spread my wings and fly to where I belong

It hurts to be untrue
To what I've gained through you
I cannot live forever
I know that I belong to only you...

So I know that often our minds maybe misleading
But my heart is not willing to stop, I feel it burning
Time will soon embrace our bound destiny
Untold my wings and I'm flying to you...

Now I know that you are the answers to my prayers and
You are my warmth and my strength, I'm not afraid now
Time will soon embrace our bound destiny
So spread my wings and I'm flying to you.
Casue I know that where I belong is with you
And my heart will flourish on moments that I'm...
With you.

Dig that groovy! Mr.Droopy.
Can you dig more deeply?
Dig that groovy! Mr.Droopy.
By the way,why is it dug?

Dirt and stones,
both hands are worn.
You greeted a mole sweatily.

He answered like this.
'The ground is too bright'

Dig that groovy! Mr,Droopy.
Was the treasure found from there?
Dig that groovy! Mr.Droopy.
By the way,how long will you dig?

There is no one.
That's the small world.
The mole is your only friend.

He answered like this.
'The ground is too bright.
Stars can be seen at noon
from deep underground.'

All along I was searching for my Lenore
In the words of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe
Now I'm sober and "Nevermore"
Will the Raven come to bother me at home
Calling you,calling you home
You... calling you,calling you home
By the door you said you had to go
Couldn't help me anymore
This I saw coming,long before
So I kept on staring out the window
Calling you, calling you home
You... calling you,calling you home
I am a natural entertainer, aren't we all
Holding pieces of dying ember
I'm just trying to remember who I can call
Who can I call
Home... calling you,calling you
I run a secret propaganda
Aren't we all hiding pieces of broken anger
I'm just trying to remember who I can call
Can I call

Born in a war of opposite attraction
It isn't, or is it a natural conception
Torn by the arms in opposite directions
It isn't, or is it a Modernist reaction

Is it like this
Is it always the same
When a heartache begins,is it like this
Do you like this
Is it always the same
Will you come back again
Do you like this
Is it always the same
Will you come back again
Do you like this
Do you like this
Is it like this
Is it always the same
If you change your phone number, will you tell me
Is it like this
Is it always the same
When a heartache begins, is it like this
If you like this
Will you remember my name
Will you play it again, if you like this

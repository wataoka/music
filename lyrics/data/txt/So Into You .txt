Don't you know that
You're the kind of guy
That I just kinda like
You don't have a clue
But I'm so into you

Take a look at me
Tell me what you see
Will you rock with me?
Take a look at me
Tell me what you see
Wilk you rock with me? (oh yeah)

当然のように二人は出逢い すぐにfriends
その日からすでに感じたvibes(uh huh)
チラチラ携帯 気にしてるfor your telephone call
キミの"only one"になりたいよ

近づけるかな? 振り向いてくれるかな?
I don't wanna be in this alone (no)
明日の事は誰も分かんないから
So please, tell me, that I'm the one you need

Don't you know that
You're the kind of guy (oh)
That I just kinda like (it's crazy)
You don't have a clue
But I'm so into you
Don't you think that
We just gotta be (oh)
Together you and me (oh baby)
You don't have a clue
But I'm in love with you

Take a look at me
Tell me what you see
Will you rock with me?
Take a look at me
Tell me what you see
Will you rock with me? (oh yeah)

約束のfriday night
今夜も二人きりでdrive
優しい横顔に戸惑うよ (uh huh)
息もできない いつもとは違うair
キミの瞳にいるのはme

夢のようだね でも夢じゃないよね?
I hope this is a mutual thing (yeah)
真っ赤なitoを今 手繰りよせてよ 早く
So please, tell me, that I'm the one you need

Don't you know that
You're the kind of guy (oh)
That I just kinda like (it's crazy)
You don't have a clue
But I'm so into you
Don't you think that
We just gotta be (oh)
Together you and me (oh baby)
You don't have a clue
But I'm in love with you

~Baby, maybe take me out
On a date just to get closer now
Maybe we can work it out
And I will show you what I'm all about
I know I'm not imagining
But I feel like I am in a dream
Tell me how you feel for me
Cuz you got me hanging on a string~

Don't you know that
You're the kind of guy (oh)
That I just kinda like (it's crazy)
You don't have a clue
But I'm so into you
Don't you think that
We just gotta be (oh)
Together you and me (oh baby)
You don't have a clue
But I'm in love with you

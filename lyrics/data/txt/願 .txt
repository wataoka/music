忘れかけてた 本当の君を
変わることない日々に 閉じ込められて
まるでぼんやり 溶けてくように
SOUL SEARCHING IS ALL I NEED TO DO
WHEN YOU'RE STUCK IN THE MOMENT
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S TRUE
ただ今一人夜が 明けるのを待って

果てしないこの道の 青く広がる先に
いつも僕らが望んでた その時は来るさ
そして いつか きっと…

BROUGHT UP IN THE HARD DAYS
DOING ALL THE WRONG THINGS
YET I HAD TO GET TO SCHOOL
旅立つから 想い出残して 明日を信じて
I KNOW I MISS IT AND I WANT TO REWIND
I THINK I BETTER LET GO
THERE'S NO ROOM INSIDE

SOUL SEARCHING IS ALL I NEED TO DO
WHEN YOU'RE STUCK IN THE MOMENT
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S TRUE
儚い夢に押し流されぬように

寂しげ月が消える やがて明ける空に
僕らが望んでた 時はいつか来るさ…

TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE GONE
IT'S LIKE THE WORLD IS TURNING UPSIDE DOWN
WE ALWAYS LOSE BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS...
I'LL BE WATCHING YOU.

NOW YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF STUCK IN THE MOMENT
NO THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
AND WHEN YOU SEE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
JUST PASSING BY JUST PASSING BY

NOW YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF STUCK IN THE MOMENT
NO THERE'S NO TURNING BACK, IT'S FOR GOOD
AND WHEN YOU SEE YOUR WHOLE LIFE JUST PASSING YOU BY
YOU CAN SAY YOU ARE IN HARMONY.

寂しげ月のそばで やさしく光る星に
ほんの僅かな奇跡でいい この願い込めて…

The ticking of time and
The murmuring whispers are all I hear
So where did our time go?
I ask for an answer to be sent

Though I see you tonight
I won't see you tomorrow
And I'm damned by all the words I can't find

I'm gonna try a little harder
Every time I hear your laughter in the wind
I'm gonna try and be better
'Cos I know you left some kindness in me

恐いものなど無いと思っていたけど
君がいないと脅かされっぱなしよ

Though I see you tonight
I won't see you tomorrow
And I feel so lost inside my mind

But I'm gonna try a little harder
Every time I feel the rain upon my skin
I'm gonna try and be better
'Cos I know I've got some love in me still

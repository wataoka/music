Feel your eyes of malice
Like a bullet through my heart
So unkind
Words,
Like gasoline,
Burn a hole into heaven
Then rain down on me
Everything falls apart

There was a time when our lives were so free
Now just another show
Innocent days slipping far away

Tell me where to go
Love is not enough
When love is not enough
Tell me
Who can I run to?
Love is not enough
Nothing matters

Feeling lost and no where
Cold and shivering
Like a black morning faded
Darkness comes
How could things be so wrong

There was a time when my love set you free
Not very long ago
What I would give for one night, today

Tell me where to go
Love is not enough
When love is not enough
Tell me
Who can I run to?
Love is not enough
Help me, please
To see the truth
Love is not enough
When love is not enough
Tell me
Who can I turn to?
Love is not enough
When love is not enough
What else matters?

I'll be there by your side
in the land of twilight
in your dream I will go
till we find the sunrise

You are lost in nightmare
deep in blue illusion
one more kiss to wake you up
come be mine, you are mine

I will be there seekin' for liminality
no destinations to see, I wander
in quiet places so dark as eternity
I'm crying, calling your name
I'm searching for you

dreaming in the land of twilight
we are in the land of twilight
deep in blue eternity
search for liminality

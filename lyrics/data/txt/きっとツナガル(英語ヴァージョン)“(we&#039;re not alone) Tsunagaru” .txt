When I raised my head up high
Saw the colors of the sky
The night I won't ever forget
All the shining stars I saw

Held my breath and tried to hear
Lovely noise of living things
And my eyes were gazing deep
At the distant light of stars

Tsunagaru,tsunagaru, voices from a distant place
Tsunagaru,tsunagaru our hearts will beat as one

One by one they disappear
Every star that had a soul
No one knows where they have gone
But we hope they'll shine again

Anyone can feel the light
Born again to give us hope
There is life in every star
There is love in who we are

Tsunagaru,tsunagaru with open arms we welcome all
Tsunagaru, tsunagaru let us hug together now

If the tears of yesterday
Overflow the path you take
Do not fear, you can go on
With the courage of this day

Then tomorrow you will see
It will lead you further on
Take you to a higher road
And you'll walk with confidence

Tsunagaru,tsunagaru tsunagaru yesterday
Tsunagaru,tsunagaru tsunagaru tomorrow

Tsunagaru,tsunagaru tsunagaru hand in hand
Tsunagaru,tsunagaru tsunagaru heart to heart

Tsunagare,tsunagare,tsunagare all of life
Tsunagare,tsunagare,tsunagare the future, too

Tsunagare,tsunagare,tsunagare all of life
Tsunagare,tsunagare,tsunagare the future, too

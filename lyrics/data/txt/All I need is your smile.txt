Let's spend the wonderful day
I want to give you a smiling
So sing a song for you
For my sweet blue bird
All I need is your smile

Don't mind You look so sad
Doesn't it rest slowly for a while?
Do you like a shuffle waltz or roll
Any styles like you as it is

Do be do Do be do do
Even if raining in your heart
Do be do Dreams comes true
Tomorrow will be sunny day

Nothing is too good for you
I love you
You know all I need is your smile
Nothing is too good for you
I love you
You know all I need is your smile
your smile...

Do be do Do be do do
Even if raining in your heart
Do be do Dreams comes true
Tomorrow will be sunny day

Nothing is too good for you
I love you
You know all I need is your smile
Nothing is too good for you
I love you
You know all I need is your smile
Your smile...

All I need is just smile

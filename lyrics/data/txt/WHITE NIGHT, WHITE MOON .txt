On this cold and busy Christmas Night
I am waiting in the snow for a taxi
My heart's yearning to be with you tonight
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
White Night, White Moon
Merry Christmas, Happy Christmas
I'll hold you soon, In the falling snow,
hurrying to you, on the frosty road so cold
to feel the Love by your Kiss

Last year this day was just another day
Never believed it could ever happen to me
Yes, My heart is full of Joy and Hope
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
White Night, White Moon
Merry Christmas, Happy Christmas
I'll hold you soon, In the falling snow,
hurrying to you, on the frosty road so cold
to feel the Magic by your Kiss

In the falling snow, hurrying to you
on the frosty road so cold
to feel the Love by your Tender, Sweet Soft,
Loving Kiss
Merry Christmas My Love

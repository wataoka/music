STREET'LL GET TO YOU, SLOWLY LIKE A SNAKE
ALWAYS WATCHING FOR ONE MISTAKE
ON YOU LIKE A SHADOW
CHASING UNDER EV'RY STEP YOU TAKE

HALF-OPEN EYES, READ YA LIKE A BOOK
WOMEN WHO KNOW, NEED NO SECOND LOOK
LIVIN' ON FACE VALUE MAKES HEARTS & DANGER ZONE
SLEEPIN' WITH STRANGERS AND WAKIN' UP ALONE

OOH, TOKYO NIGHTS
OOH, EMPTY DAYS
OOH, MAKE YOU CRAZY

ICE IN YOUR VEINS, FEVER IN YOUR SOUL
WALKING IN A WORLD YOU CAN'T CONTROL
HALFWAY TO INSANE, SOMEONE CALLED YOUR NAME
GOING DOWN TO PLAY

OOH, TOKYO NIGHTS
OOH, EMPTY DAYS
OOH, MAKE YOU CRAZY

Come on! Come on! Everybody party now
Come on! Come on! ここに集まって
Come on! Come on! 気ままに踊ろう
Come on! Come on! And listen to the DJ

何を気にし悩んでるの?
すべて忘れ 見知らぬ君と夢を見よう
流れる汗が胸をつたい
輝く今

Move your body, shake a shake your body
Move your body to hazumu
Move your body, shake a shake your body
shake a shake a shake it to rhythm
Move your body, shake a shake your body
Move your body pumpin' bass
Move your body, shake a shake your body
And listen to the DJ

Come on! Come on! このまま夜明けに
Come on! Come on! 君を連れ去り
Come on! Come on! 海まで飛ばそう
Come on! Come on! And listen to the DJ

一人きりで 泣いてないで
みんな一緒に楽しもうよ
今日もすぐに 去ってしまう
だから Mm ほらね 笑顔でいよう

Move your body, shake a shake your body
Move your body to atsuku
Move your body, shake a shake your body
shake a shake a shake it to nosete
Move your body, shake a shake your body
Move your body kickin' beat
Move your body, shake a shake your body
And listen to the DJ

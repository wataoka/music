Hello, Hello? Hello, Hello?
Who's calling?
Calling a wrong number, right?
What's wrong? What's wrong with you?

笑顔をさがしに街へ出て
流れこむリズムに乗って
心臓が動く動く動く
この苛立ちも行き場を失って

キレイな色に見えるけどね
明かりは私の心おおってく
Pinkの香りにむらがる本能
そんな生きものだ なんて笑ってる
(Sorry, I can't understande Japanese)
She's biting her nails
She's biting her nails
Hiding her light
Hiding her face

She's biting her nails
She's biting her nails
She's hiding her mind
I want to know…! Why you're so alone

What's the matter with you?
What's wrong? What's wrong with you?

それをよろこびあやつる凡能に
成り下がりたくはないから動く動く
どこか曲がった欲望を
今も尚まねた uh love love love

自分に酔いしれ
とけあう2人に残るしずくは
おのれの顔にかかるだけ
うすっぺらな満たされ方
笑い合う高なる声に私は耳をふさぐ
汗を流すこと涙を流すこと
何のためだかわからなくなってるよ
未だになんでかわからない

(Sorry, I'm busy)
She's biting her nails
She's biting her nails
Hiding her light
Hiding her face

She's hurting her nails
She's biting her nails
Hiding in silence for who?

She's hiding the air
She's hiding her face
She's hiding the space
She's hiding her face

She's biting her nails
She's still biting nails
She's still biting nails in her room

I heard my phone ring
Pick up the phone&amp;think
Who can it be at this time?
Who can call me on this line?
I wanna hear your story
I wanna hear your story
I wanna hear your story
True & Clear

空気の悪いその場所で
交わす2人の言葉の罪は
おのれの心につつまれてくだけ
くだけくだけ散っていくよ

She's biting her nails
She's biting her nails
She's hiding her face
She's hiding the earth

She's hurting her nails
She's biting her nails
She's hiding her face
She's hiding her mind

She's biting her nails
She's biting her nails
She's hiding her face
She's hiding her mind

She's biting her nails
She's biting her nails
She's hiding the space over who?

I can't help you
gone gone gone

I'm worried about her…but I can't help you

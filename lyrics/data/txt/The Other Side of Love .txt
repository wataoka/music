in my heart,I know I must be right
darkest shadows will someday come to light
I've been down,but I can rise above
I keep searching for the other side of love

looking for fun was just a game to me
never knew what each lonely day would bring
now I'm so tired of trying to run away
I've got to find a love that's here to stay

in my heart, I know the day will come
we'll be laughing and dancing in the sun
what I've found has never been enough
I keep searching for the other side of love

I always heard that love's supposed to be
more than a word and more than just a dream
someone to share your every joy and pain
someone who's there for sunshine and the rain

in my heart, I know I must be right
darkest shadows will someday come to light
I've been down,but I can rise above
I keep searching for the other side of love

あなたと出逢うために
私は生まれてきた
息絶える時さえも
ギュッとしててね we'll be one

in my heart,I know the day will come
we'll be laughing and dancing in the sun
what I've found has never been enough
I keep searching for the other side of love

in my heart, I know I must be right
I keep searching for the other side of love

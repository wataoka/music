Driving fast down a one way street
Lord of loving you dance so sweet
Going fast to hit the sky
Lord of love you don't ask me why

I said electricity
Let it rain all over me
Let the light be forever green
I'm playing with fire if you know what I mean
I need someone to help me
Turn it on

Driving fast babe I'm on my own
I'm gonna meet you on a one way road
Gonna crash, kiss the sky
Lord of love you don't ask me why

I said electricity
Let it wash all over me
Let the light be forever green
I'm playing with fire if you know what I mean
I need someone to help me
Turn it on

Driving fast down a one way street
Lord of loving you dance so neat
Baby try not to hit the sky
Baby try not to make me cry
I said electricity
Electricity
Turn it on

感性と感覚の渦に
Instinct reacts
波形踊らせてくれ
My brain

[Refuse the limit of the head]
The image is embodied until die

Refuse the limit of the myself
In this situation nothing is born

[Refuse the limit of the head]
The image is embodied until die

Refuse the limit of the myself
In this situation nothing is born

I starve for a shock everyday
Give me noise...
Nausea does not stop every night
Give me noise...

Abandon fear
Spit out the greed

In this world that accomplished a change
I felt dissatisfaction
In this world that accomplished a change
Venomous which does not breeding
In this world that accomplished a change
If there is an king...
In this world that accomplished a change
Who is a joker?

I starve for a shock everyday
Give me noise...
Nausea does not stop every night
さぁ狂わせてくれ

Method to satisfy a desire
It is attitude of myself
Only this sound is supremacy
Creature of the self-satisfaction

Abandon fear
Spit out the greed
Abandon fear
An enemy is oneself

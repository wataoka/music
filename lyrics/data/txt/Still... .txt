Still...
Inside a funny dream
I'm following you everywhere you go

Still...
Inside a funny dream
I'm soaked in tears everywhere I go

Caught up in this world
Like in a daydream
Lost in your smile
But I wake up to a lonely dawn
To know you're gone
My endless love...

Still...
Inside a funny dream
I'm following you everywhere you go
Stil...
Inside a funny dream
I'm soaked in tears everywhere I go

Caught up in this world
Like in a daydream
Lost in your smile
But I wake up to a lonely dawn
To know you're gone
My endless love...

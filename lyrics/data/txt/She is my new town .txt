Come on and hold me tight
Then kiss me softly
You make me feel so good
I just want to feel you now

I just knew that you are my destiny
From the day I saw you for the very first time
We'll never be apart. We'll be together
I feel you are my everything

Come on and hold me tight
Then kiss me softly
You make me feel so good
I just want to feel you now

When you touch me, it feels like I'm in heaven
I hope you feel the same (way as I do)
If I'm with you, I don't need anything
Cause I just know that you are my everything

Come on and hold me tight
Then kiss me softly
You make me feel so good
I just want to feel you now

Come on and hold me tight
Then kiss me softly
You make me feel so good
I just want to feel you now

Baby, can you hear me now? 
Anytime you're torn inside,
I'll be there I'll be with you
Everywhere you go, I'll see
Don't you feel it? 
Look around you,
I believe you and your dreams, time's too short

Maybe, you don't notice now,
every time you're with me,
I'm like a restless child,
I can't say anything cool
I'm so lost well, 
what to say and what to wear and what to sing,
time's too long

I want you to need me, 
although I'm not a perfect girl,
I have something in mind
Move forward and I can bail you out of such darkness,
yes, in this world

Shiny, shiny daydream, no matter how far away
I'm rolling, rolling, into you  I'm rolling, rolling get me yeah

Shiny, shiny daydream, no matter how intriguing
I'm rolling, rolling into you,
it's clear I love you as you are …oh

Well, are you happy now?
You look a little bit tired these days, 
bet you give them everything,
It's not fair, but you'll never see
I'm thinking what to do to make you realize you deserve to a better life.

I do wanted to save you I know it's not a perfect world,
I have something in mind
So I try and try again till everything is going right,
yes, in this world

Shiny, shiny daydream, no matter how far away
I'm rolling, rolling into you, I'm rolling, rolling get me yeah

Shiny, shiny daydream, no matter how intriguing
I'm rolling, rolling into you, I wanna give you all my love…oh

I wanna hear you say "I'm missing you"
You don't have to strain yourself anymore
You can change your life, I wish you joy
Hey, come on, get together and welcome a new world

Shiny, shiny daydream, no matter how far away
I'm rolling, rolling, into you  I'm rolling, rolling get me yeah

Shiny, shiny daydream, no matter how intriguing
I'm rolling, rolling into you, it's clear I love you as you are …oh

I wanna give you all my love

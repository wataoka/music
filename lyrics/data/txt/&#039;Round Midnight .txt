It begins to tell when midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' so sad
But it really gets bad, midnight, midnight

When some quarrel we had need mending
Does it mean that my love is ending
I need you, that's what I found
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

The night is on my mind, I know the sun'll still shine
But now the night is on my mind, oh

Memories always start when midnight, midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

When some quarrel we had need mending
Does it mean that my love is ending
I need you, that's what I found
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

When some quarrel we had need mending
Does it mean that my love is ending
I need you, that's what I found
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Because I need you hey...
Memories, memories, memories
They always start round midnight
Round about, round about, round about...
Said I'm gonna miss you baby
Really bad, really bad, really bad...

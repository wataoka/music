What can I tell you, this guy you see
I can't help feeling, so cool hip and so free
I don't believe in getting hooked on love, no not me.

You can't persuade me, to play your game
You turn your nose up, whenever I'm acting the same
The way I move is oh so smooth, I'm cool
I know you want to hold me, Cool Kat.

Just leave me drinkin', in this bar tonight
I know you want me, to make you, make you feel right
But all you do is hang your head so low
I know you really want me, to go.

Why can't you, please understand
What kind of man I've got to be
You're saying, I'm such a fool hiding my thoughts away from
you girl I know it's driving you wild
I'm sorry I'm a Cool Kat baby.

You can't persuade me, to play your game
You turn your nose up, whenever I'm acting the same
The way I move is oh so smooth, I'm cool
I know you want to hold me, Cook Kat.

IF I HAVE TO REMAIN YOU SHOULD GO YOUR OWN WAY.
WHENEVER YOU CAN'T LOOK AT ME JUST BELIEVE YOURSELF.
EVEN IF I FEEL SO SAD, WASH IT ALL AWAY.
YOU CAN CLIMB UP FROM THE DEEP NO FEAR IN YOUR MIND.

THE WEAK STEPS THAT YOU TAKE
SMILE OF YOUR BARE HANDS.
STRETCH YOUR ARMS THE BEST YOU CAN.
THE WEAK STEPS THAT YOU TAKE
AND THE SMILE OF YOUR BARE HANDS.
STRETCH YOUR ARMS.

EVEN IF YOU LOSE YOUR WAY, GO AHEAD GET TIED DOWN.
WHATEVER YOU FALL INTO, YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN FEELINGS.
IF YOU CAN'T THINK OF TOMORROW,
DON'T BE AFRAID.
YOU CAN WALK ALONG THE DEEP TRAIL OF SADNESS.

THE WEAK STEPS THAT YOU TAKE
SMILE OF YOUR BARE HANDS.
STRETCH YOUR ARMS THE BEST YOU CAN.
THE WEAK STEPS THAT YOU TAKE
AND THE SMILE OF YOUR BARE HANDS.
STRETCH YOUR ARMS MUCH HIGHER.

THE DAYS WITHOUT SUNLIGHT, GLOWS IS GONE.
ONLY THOSE HANDS WITH NO LIGHT WILL ANSWER.
YOUR HANDS WITH NO LIGHT, ARE COMING ALONG TO.
THOSE HANDS WILL BRING THE NEXT RESPONSE.

GIVE ME YOUR SMILE AFTER YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING.
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE, IN THE MIDDLE.
GIVE ME SOME WORDS PLEASE, AFTER EVERYTHING HAS GONE.
I KNOW AS I LOOK AT YOU.

THOSE LONG THOUGHTS AFTER THE END.

私が閊えたならば 先に進んで下さい
何度振り向こうとも必ず進んで下さい
悲哀に震えたなら 凡てを洗い流して下さい
堂々たる無心の底辺から昇って下さい

そのか弱き歩みよ
素手の笑みよ
手伸ばせ 手伸ばせ
その手を…

路頭に迷ったなら 途方に暮れて下さい
消沈する事なく凡てを受け入れてください
明日を疑っても 焦らずにいて下さい
一切の悲傷と共に進んで下さい

そのか細い行いよ
無垢の君よ
求めて 求めて
限りを…

暗黙の日々の中で
君の手が答えるでしょう
光り無きその手が
次の荷を運ぶのでしょう

笑顔は全ての後でいい
今は最中の事なので
言葉も全ての後でいい
姿が現実を映すので

追憶など全くの後でいい

Silhouettes can fade at a masquerade
But it's always the same
Every time you leave, you never go away
I'm a mystery, but the story of this
Is both yours and mine
Is it love, or don't you have the time?

'Cause we've set the perfect scene
Couldn't have found it in a magazine
Is this where every promise takes a chance?
Now we're close as two could be
Feels like the magic's elementary
So tell me it's my turn
And more than Moonburn

Charisma is the thing, it's like a diamond ring
That shines forever for me
But will it be the light that's left me in the dark
I know I trust my heart, I wish I knew why I feel
My calendar said I'd meet my destiny

'Cause we've set the perfect scene
Couldn't have found it in a magazine
Is this where every promise takes a chance?
Now we're close as two could be
Feels like the magic's elementary
So tell me it's my turn
And more than Moonburn

It's not the sun distressing me
From midnight to midday
Where is the Romeo who knows the way?
To take my hand so deep in his
Not for the weak, the mild or meek
The feeling still remains

'Cause we've set the perfect scene
Couldn't have found it in a magazine
Is this where every promise takes a chance?
Now we're close as two could be
Feels like the magic's elementary
So tell me it's my turn
And more than Moonburn

At times the road we take
The choices that we make
Can be painful and heavy on our shoulders

But if it gets you down
Just hold your head up high
And look to the sky
A rainbow will appear

In this ever fast and changing world
People can be cruel and so cold
And leave you out alone in the dark
Even though you stumble and you fall
You will find the strength to carry on
In your heart

On Wings of Love I'll fly
Race across the morning sky
To be by your side and kiss the tears away
No matter where you are
How far apart
I'll be there for you, my one and only one

If you should ever find
No rest or peace of mind
Don't you worry, I'll shelter you from harm

Remember that in time
The sorrow and the pain
Will soon fade away
And you'll come shining through

In this ever fast and changing world
People can be cruel and so cold
And leave you out alone in the dark
Even though you stumble and you fall
You will find the strength to carry on
In your heart

On Wings of Love I'll fly
Race across the morning sky
To be by your side and kiss the tears away
No matter where you are
How far apart
I'll be there for you, my one and only one

I'll be there for you, my one and only one

So here he comes, right on time
And he has class, 'n quite a style
All of his own and they all know him
As Lupin, the third

He walks the line, one fine line
Though danger lies, he'll be just fine
He's here today but gone tomorrow
He's Lupin, the third

All his life has been
One roller coaster ride of dreams
No time for looking back
Never regretting that
His smile is all that he can leave behind

And there he goes, nice and slow
Wish he would stay, another day
So we can dance, darkness away
My Lupin, the third

All his life has been
One roller coaster ride of dreams
No time for looking back
Forgetting who or what
His song is all that he can leave behind

On silent nights, I hear him still
Whisting a tune I know so well
Gun in hand, rose in another
He's Lupin, the third

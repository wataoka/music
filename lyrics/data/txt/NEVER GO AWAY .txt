Don't say a ward
I can read your mind
It's alright
You don't have to lie
You don't have to try

Don't be afraid
It'll all work out
Don't cry
You've got me tonight
Things will be alright

I'II never go away
My love is here to stay
Never again will you be sad and blue
NO more lonely nights
You can close your weary eyes
Lay your head beside me baby, good-night

Don't hesitate
Let your feelings show
Don't hide
Babe, I understand
Let me take your hand

I'll never go away
Forever, I'm here to stay
Look in my eyes, you'll see a love that's true
Whenever you're in pain
You can just call out my name
Don't you know that I will always be there

I'II never go away
My love is here to stay
Never again will you be sad and blue
NO more lonely nights
You can close your weary eyes
Lay your head beside me baby, good-night

I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say, no
Tell me why is it so

I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says turn around you fool
You know you love her more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no

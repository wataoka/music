Words have disappeared into the cold
The ice will keep them there, and I am told
Now the empty night is coming
Wait, and see, but no one can melt the snow in me

Staring deep into the winter night
The crystal ground reflects a gleaming light
But behind me all is empty
Wait, and see, only I can melt the snow in me

You arrived, you saved me from the fading stars
And the light you gave me filled my empty heart
Then you gently wept my frozen tears away
Saviour is your name today

Found the heart I thought that I had lost
I buried it too deep beneath the frost
I can feel my walls are breaking
Wait, and see, maybe you can melt the snow in me

Through the blizzard, on you I will lean
Just like the fir tree you are evergreen
Now it seems the black is fading
Wait, and see, maybe I am not alone,

I am not alone,
I am not alone,
I am not alone,
at all

this time
we melt
the snow
I'll wait
until

you have arrived, you saved me from the fading stars
And the light you gave me filled my empty heart
Then you gently wept my frozen tears away
Saviour is your name today

you saved me from the fading stars
And the light you gave me filled my empty heart
Then you gently wept my frozen tears away
Saviour is your name today

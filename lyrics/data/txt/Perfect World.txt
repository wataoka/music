★None is just where one pretends and wonders
　Counting for a Perfect World to mind us

One can be a word that count
as lonely
Two can be as lonely as each
can be
Searching and pretending
As we wonder through this world
Can we ever know
Where hearts go

Three is ever perfect just as
clear minds
Four till nine is given to one
who finds
Searching and pretending
We'll never know
Can't we say hello

Do we still just look to count
Until we face each mount
Worlds make such a part with love
For we know all what accounts
Just show just announce

＊If we add the fractions
　To the simple answer
　Then each love will figure
　To one Perfect World

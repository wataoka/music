You're not the only one who feels very insecure
So I don't wanna say something to let you down
Now I'll take you by the hand Don't Be afraid!

火のついた導火線 やけに喉が渇く
監視カメラを抜け出したのなら
くたびれた街 その景色の向こうへ

Stand up! 吠えろライオン!
You gotta move! Let's start a riot!

You're not the only one who feels very insecure
So I don't wanna say something to let you down
Now I'll take you by the hand Don't Be afraid!

僕らは互いを映し出す鏡
割れた破片が 泣き言を言う
撃ち抜いてくれ その眼差しで 世界を

You're not the only one who feels very insecure
So I don't wanna say something to let you down
Now I'll take you by the hand Don't Be afraid

Stand up! 吠えろライオン!
You gotta move! Let's start a riot

I like feel I've come to realize that part of me
I tell you, there's a riot in my heart
この胸にたぎる血潮で

You're not the only one who feels very insecure
So I don't wanna say something to let you down
Now I'll take you by the hand Don't Be afraid

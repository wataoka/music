Could this mean that it's over
After all that we've done together
All the promises we made yesterday
Are they gone （gone away today）

Everytime I turn around
I pray you'll be there next to me
My man, in love, once again by my side
There you are, Come back and you will see

Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love takes over me
Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love just sets me free free free

There's never too big a problem
That we can't work it out together
We always promised each other before
Were we wrong （is it too far gone）

And everytime the phone rings
I pray you're callin' back to me
My man, in love, once again on the line
Tellin' me, that it's plain to see

Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love takes over me
Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love just sets me free free free

Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love takes over me
Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love just sets me free free free

Round and round, love's a merry-go-round
It never stops, just keeps spinnin' round
Never stop, I never wanna get off
Wanna be with you for all time

Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love takes over me
Just like magic, whenever we're together
Love just sets me free free free

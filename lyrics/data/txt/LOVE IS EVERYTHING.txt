いつかめぐり逢える　やさしいなにか求め
君の心の弦（いと）ふるわせて　ほほえみをうかべる

＊I only know that I love her
　The girl of my dreams I must find her
　Thinking of time we'll be spending
　Thinking of love we'll be sharing
　I'll know that girl when she comes near
　filling my heart with these dreams,
　but I know that until then I'll feel alone

Love is everything,Love to share with you

※Two eyes speaking of Love
　Two arms hold two lips that know
　how good it is to be together
　Like in a dream,Love only glows and it grows

＊Repeat
※Repeat
＊Repeat

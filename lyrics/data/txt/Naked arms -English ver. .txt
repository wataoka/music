All those dreams, all of my hope, all life come undone
In a world beaten and broken I can see a rising sun
Burning down, scorching the earth, nowhere left to hide
Try to stop all this destruction, find a way, turn the tide
Reveal the bond that's made
Between the light and the shade

Shining white and hot is a moon so unforgiving
The break of day will leave a scar
Nothing we believe can protect us from tomorrow
Enjoy today from where we are

I will believe to the end
Even with my face pressed to the fire
I won't be shaken or moved
By the heat getting closer and higher

Sink or swim
Lose or win
Hold on with my naked arms

All those dreams, all of my hope, all life come undone
In a world beaten and broken I can see a rising sun
Burning down, scorching the earth, nowhere left to hide
Try to stop all this destruction, find a way, turn the tide
Reveal the bond that's made
Between the light and the shade

Everywhere I go there is dark and there is sorrow
It's always just a step away
Always so amazing the evil sky above me
It always seems so far away

Look in the water and see
Mirrored memories scatter and sink inside
Friendships are broken and made
Now the curtain has fallen on those who tried

Flowers rise
Stormy skies
Feel heaven's power on earth

I see my infinite dreams coming to an end
Sparks are flying, but my spirit will not break or even bend
Now I see my destiny only brings me pain
Now the sunshine and the shade are forced together again
I choose to follow the light
Flowing through me here tonight

I see my infinite dreams coming to an end
Sparks are flying, but my spirit will not break or even bend
Now I see all of my fire only brings me pain
From inside me or around me I will burn just the same
Moving up, I'll never stop
Until I come out on top

My day in the hills has come to an end, I know
A star has come out to tell me it's time to go
But deep in the dark green shadows
Are voices that urge me to stay
So I pause and I wait and I listen
For one more sound
For one more lovely thing
That the hills might say!

The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies from a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

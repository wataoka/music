Are you ready? From coast to coast all around the world
From the north from the south from the east west around the world

So ready or not ready or not here we come now
So ready or not ready or not here we come now
So why? Why don't you come along with me?
Let us go starting from America

We'll climb to the top of the mountain to see morning rise and
We'll ride through the desert under the moon and the stars
So I'll take you away all round the world round the world round the world

Are you ready? From coast to coast all around the world
From the north from the south from the east west around the world

So ready or not ready or not here we come now
So ready or not ready or not here we come now
So why? Why don't you come along with me?
Let us go starting from America

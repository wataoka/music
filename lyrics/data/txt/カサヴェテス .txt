Opening night, Performing
I'm growing the shadow like a one way surfer cruising

May rain may, snatch away my feeling
Is it joking or curiosity?
Soloist is me
I got no rules

Second night, under my castle
I'm growing the roots like an ocean wide and open in the silence

May rain may, snatch away my feeling
Is it joking or curiosity?
Soloist is me
I got no rules
And sense of time
Is it joking or curiosity?
Soloist is me
I got no rules

Third night, throwing away my clothes
I'm spinning the sweetest thing
You know it's just beginning
Only time's fading away

May rain may
Is it joking or curiosity?
Soloist is me
I got no rules
And sense of time
Is it joking or curiosity?
Soloist is me
I got no rules

I don't want to wear a tie
'Cause I'll still move on like a sorrowful sparrow
With my mysterious show
Where a spotlight turns me on
Leaving behind one side shoe

Knowing all the best in me and in you
Sweat colors memories
Coffin' is laughing
Grooving with the best in me and in you
Sweat colors memories
Coffin' is laughing
Knowing all the best in shade and in bright
Let us be jazzed
With the Stripper Suites
I'm gone now

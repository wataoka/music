Somebody to love... somebody to love
And I know she can hear me say
I want somebody to love... somebody to love
No I won't stop until she's with me

教えて欲しい What's Luv?
相通じるって噂
No one yet 初めて
感じるこんな感情
I'm falling for you twenty-four
見つめるのは It's you
胸騒ぎ How should I control my heart and soul?

恥じを忍んでも Excuse me miss
確信できなくてもいい I got u babe
俺に少しでも望みがあるなら
今この時からココロを委ねてよ

Somebody to love... somebody to love
And I know she can hear me say
I want somebody to love... somebody to love
No I won't stop until she's with me

Gee, now that I got plenty hope
I can't wait, yo, as we go just two of us
On and on the love zone we're takin' it in
Doin' all the above all over again
Move it to the kitchen, take my hand
Be my angel-ring my bell

That's what I'm sayin' oh, I'm
Feelin' like a million, yo
You do make my dreams come true

Gotta let the whole world know
Si-sit back relax no sound I'ma
Turn that on to the break 'o dawn
Indeed yo we 'gon make it bounce.....

Somebody to love... somebody to love
And I know she can hear me say
I want somebody to love... somebody to love
No I won't stop until she's with me

もどかしい気持ちが渦巻くたび
胸に募る想いが溢れ出す
君へ届くよう I sing this luv song
You need Somebody to Luv to
Somebody to Luv you

「誰か」を愛して
「誰か」に愛され
「誰か」と別れ どこかでまた
「誰か」が「誰か」と巡り会う中
これが最後のLove

Somebody to love... somebody to love
And I know she can hear me say
I want somebody to love... somebody to love
No I won't stop until she's with me

They think that they'll see flowers
If only they give water
But the harvest season's over
The time has past

Here in the dark I'm sittin'
The answer that soon I'm gettin'
How do I know where it comes from?
Just wanna feel safe with you

※Now let me hear your voice
　Just for once
　'Cause you've mixed all my bits
　You grabbed all my soul
　You've taken everything over
　Now let me hear your voice
　Just for once
　You know you can make me smile
　You can make me cry
　And take me out from these nights of longing

You know how long I've waited
I wonder what has faded
The color of those petals
Just trod in mud

Give your hand, can you feel now
Close your eyes, then you'll reach out
The feeling you have now
Should be all transformed to love

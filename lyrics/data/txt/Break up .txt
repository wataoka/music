(Oh… We'll never break up)

聞けるわけがない 噂は真実? 君はfantastic girl (No)
哀しげな瞳 (What's wrong?) その翳りは何? (Be mine) 急に焦るよ

(In the dark) ただ君は (Tenderly) いたずらな (Sweet devil)
僕を呼ぶ (Emotion) 抱きしめる
(Tell me why) 比べてる (Who is it?) 隠してる
(Can you feel me?) Oh Yeah

Just can't get enough I want you すべてを見せて
Just can't get enough I want you 僕だけを見て
謎めく君が 投げかけるのは
Oh Break up (Break up Break up)
Oh Break up (Break up)

You gotta know how I feel
My feelings are all for you
All the time 24/7 I'm on you
But it's like red light green light stop and go
So just forget about the rest
Cuz we ain't here to go slow

ゲーム感覚だね 恋を楽しむの? 無邪気な dazzling smile (No)
本気にさせたい (My girl) 君を離さない (True love) これが罠でも

(Close to me) 巻き髪が (Deeply touch) 迷い込む (You and I)
迷宮で (Tell a lie) 抱きしめる
(Say the word) 最後だと (Whispering) 火をつける
(Can you feel me?) Oh Yeah

Just can't get enough I want you どんな君でも
Just can't get enough I want you 愛し続ける
追えば追うほど 君のペースだ
Oh Break up (Break up Break up)
Oh Break up (Break up)

Gonna loose control so we gotta go
Stop time like your first time
Breaking down for the last time
So just stop
Lying to me now
Jumping up and down
Stomping on the ground
Spinning round and round

the beginning I thought this was all just a dream BUT
in this game that we called love it was only me WHEN
you said that you loved me It was harder to see THAT
the only thing you wanted was pack up and leave. (just like)

Just can't get enough I want you すべてを見せて
Just can't get enough I want you 僕だけを見て
謎めく君が 投げかけるのは
Oh Break up (Break up Break up)
Oh Break up (Break up)

Just can't get enough I want you どんな君でも
Just can't get enough I want you 愛し続ける
追えば追うほど 君のペースだ
Oh Break up (Break up Break up)
Oh Break up (Break up)

(We will never break up) Oh Baby
(We will never break up) We'll never break up Oh Baby
Oh Break up (Break up Break up)
Oh Break up (Break up)

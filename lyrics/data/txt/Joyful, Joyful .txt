Joyful, Joyful
Lord, we adore Thee
God of grory
Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh, fill us with the light of day...

Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us
Fill us with the light of day

So we sing

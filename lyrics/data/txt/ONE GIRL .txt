'Cuz you need need me too
Ay ay ay
I think about you every single day day day
I'm gonna(gonna)tell 'em(tell 'em)

'Cuz you're my light my love

Feeling like a new millionaire

There's only one girl
Only one one one girl

To make me feel the best best
Just shine the way you are
You shootin' like a star
But I won't let you fall far
'Cuz I'm never gonna leave you solo, solo

(You the one)I'm always gonna count on
(You the one)that's there when the money gone
You always be around
You never knock me down down down

Feeling like a new millionaire

There's only one girl
Only one one one girl

You know I'll never leave you oh oh oh

Only one girl fo' me
Only one I see
Even though she's next to me

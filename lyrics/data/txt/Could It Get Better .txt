Could it get better than this

I would lie to you
Just to make you tell the truth
始まりも 終わりも わからなくて

If I tried みつめ合いたい
変わるはずのdistance 信じている

突然の雨降るMonday
君とならspecial day
運命みたいに感じる
その右手が遠くて

Maybe it's the things You do
Maybe it's the weather
Gotta ask one thing of You
Could it get better?
Crazy but I know it's true
Crazy to the letter
Words I write I won't undo
Could it get better than this

映画なら1人で行く主義
でも君とならば 2人でもいい

I rely on 独りじゃみえない
新しい世界 みつけられそう

こだわるピアスのcolor
君と会うspecial day
1000年待ってた気分は
隠しておこう

Maybe it's the things You do
Maybe it's the weather
Gotta ask one thing of You
Could it get better?
Crazy but I know it's true
Crazy to the letter
Words I write I won't undo
Could it get better than this

Could it get better than this

Baby tell me  Could it get better? Better than this

Cause I might be sweeter than chocolate
And a little bit bitter too
Sure tastes better than the best you had
From a place that you never knew

Maybe it's the things You do
Maybe it's the weather
Gotta ask one thing of You
Could it get better?
Crazy but I know it's true
Crazy to the letter
Words I write I won't undo
Could it get better than this

Maybe it's the things You do
Maybe it's the weather
Gotta ask one thing of You
Could it get better?
Crazy but I know it's true
Crazy to the letter
Words I write I won't undo
Could it get better than this

Could it get better than this

your Haviannas make me feel i'm in Havana,
sippin on Pina Colada, at the coco-cabana, mami
you got a little Mary Poppins and it sho poppin' off,
you're candy droppin and my heart has stopped
and simply walked off,
i never meant to make you cry and i know things are tough,
but we'll make it through all the drama
cause like you there is no other.

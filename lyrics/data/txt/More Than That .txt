If that's the way you're gonna be
I'd rather stay here alone and naked
If that's the way you're gonna live
Go get your own life
I think you've taken mine

Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't you give me more than that?
Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't give me more than that?

If I'm the one you're gonna need
I'll give you eyes while you're riding on my engine
But if that's the way you're gonna see
I think I'll keep them while I watch you crawing in the dark

Oh I never thought that my time in hell would start until I was six feet under
But it's already begun
Oh the nature of the creature's taking over the soul that I've spent my whole life on

Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't you give me more than that?
Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't you give me more than that?
You sink my soul!
I don't like it, I don't need it!

Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't you give me more than that?
Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't give me more than that?
Who is it you see?
Who is it you need?
Who is it you see?
Who is it you need

You really make me feel that core
You really make me sink
You really have a blight injection
You really have it all

Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb taking my time
But can't you give me more than that?
Hey pretty little thing
You came to me a long bomb ticking on, a long bomb ticking on
More than that

Oh pretty little thing you came to me a long bomb!

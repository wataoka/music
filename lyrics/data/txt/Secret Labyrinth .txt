Burning with desire
To get back my treasure
I know now what I'm supposed to do
Seeking my own truth
And the real meaning of my life

I'm hearing a beat, another part of me
Tell me - Is it guilty or not guilty?
In my heart, conflict with some sort of confusion

Head off a crisis, keep looking for bliss
I don't wanna be a hapless victim
Sigh no more, get over a big aggravation

Have a complicated question
Lord gives me a suggestion
What I need is a stronger belief
Won't cry, I'll fly away

Keep my hope alive
Decided to dive
Into a secret labyrinth
Love and hate, I feel my lips move
No one notices in this twisted world
Gotta try to survive
Won't fail to arrive
Beyond a secret labyrinth
Right or wrong, think of a reason
Never run away
Just wake up to another day
Find my way

Keep my aim alive
Now it's time to dive
Into a secret labyrinth
Love and fate, hide my scars and pain
No one knows in this uncertain world
Gotta fight to survive
Can't wait to arrive
Beyond a secret labyrinth
Right or left, which way should I turn?
I stumble away
I'll definitely win someday
Go my way

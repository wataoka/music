水面を揺らした花は儚く
ゆえに激しく舞い散る

心の中ずっと あの日の君が
あの微笑みが 消えない 消せない

Time
君をいつまでも守りたかった
I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side
I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side

誰もがいつかきっと 旅立つことを
気づいてしまうから さよなら さよなら

Why?
時は刻まれる 永遠に
I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side
So I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side

Still
僕を呼ぶ声が聞こえてくる
I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side
I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side
So I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side
I don't want to leave here now
Right by your side
I'll be right by your side 
For the rest of my life

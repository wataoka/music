Don't you know about this story?
I met you only just three times
To be honest I will tell you
I'm in love with a younger boy!

Why is it big boy you want
To act this cold and I don't know?
You be thinkin' I'm hurtin'
It don't mean that much to me!

Who, Can't stand to see your face
Who, I can see me asking!
Small nothings need something
Won't you tell me wee bit more?
More I want More I need
Give me words that are true Please, please
You can talk Not forever
Just a word
To be heard by just
Me that is all

Who, Can't stand to see your face
Who, I can see me asking!
Small nothings need something
Won't you tell me wee bit more?
More I want More I need
Give me words that are true Please, please
You can talk Not forever
Just a word
To be heard by just
Me that is all

I wanna die with you and learn to live again
Just stay with me and will fall in love again
I want you touch you kiss you want you now

You ran away and left me all alone
I fucked around and tried so herd to forget you
But now I want you back come back to me

I'm sick of this plastic ocean
Drifting so far from you
I'm sick of this plastic emotion
I wanna get back and love you

I wanna sleep with you and make you come again
I'm dreamin of your sweet soft sexy body them
I want you eat you lick you want you now

I'm sick of this plastic ocean
Drifting so far from you
I'm sick of this plastic emotion
I wanna get back and love you

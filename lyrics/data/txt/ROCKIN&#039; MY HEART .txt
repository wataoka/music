Hey little love hey little lover
I'm coma,coma comin' apart
Hey little love hey little lover
You're rockin',rockin' rockin' my heart
Lights of the city Burning so cold
They don't make my world so bright
There's too many miles From here to my lover
Somewhere beyond the night
Hey little love hey little lover
I'm coma,coma comin' apart
Hey little love hey little lover
You're rockin',rockin' rockin' my heart
I'll see you in my dreams
You had me from the start
I'm over my head Baby you're rockin' my heart
More than a need More than desire
I only wish that I knew the part
You turned me around Set me fire
You're rockin',rockin' rockin' my heart
Hey little love hey little lover
I'm coma,coma comin' apart
Hey little love hey little lover
You're rockin',rockin' rockin' my heart
Lights of the city Burning so cold
They don't make my world so bright
There's too many miles From here to my lover
Somewhere beyond the night
Hey little love hey little lover
I'm coma,coma comin' apart
Hey little love hey little lover
You're rockin',rockin' rockin' my heart
Hey little love hey little lover
I'm coma,coma comin' apart
Hey little love hey little lover
You're rockin',rockin' rockin' my heart

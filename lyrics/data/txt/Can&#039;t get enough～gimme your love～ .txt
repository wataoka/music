Gimme your love
Can I get enough get closer
I can't get enough Can't get enough

切ない胸の奥
君への想い描(か)く
優しい君の声
But you don't understand my heart and soul
Don't be afraid to love me
時間(とき)ばかり過ぎ去っていくよ
I'll tell you what I want
'Cuz I've wondering
そばにいたいよ

そう Open up the door
Uncover the mystery
今しかない 今だから
I'll tell you how I feel tonight

Open up the door
You'll never have to worry
今しかない 今だから
My love will take you higher

Gimme your love
Can I get enough get closer
I can't get enough Can't get enough

この気持ちユズレナイ
後悔したくない
君を誤解しそう
But you don't understand my heart and soul
Don't be afraid to love me
君のハート感じていたいよ
Will you tell me what you want
'Cuz I've wondering
そばにいたいよ

そう Open up the door
Uncover the mystery
今しかない 今だから
I'll tell you how I feel tonight

Open up the door
You'll never have to worry
今しかない 今だから
My love will take you higher

Gimme your love
Can I get enough get closer
I can't get enough Can't get enough

I WAS SO BLUE TONIGHT
UNTIL I SAW YOU IN THE CROWD, SO BRIGHT
LIKE THE SUN IN THE SKY
BUT THEN I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU HOW I FEEL

IS THIS LOVE TRUE LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IS THIS HOW IT FEELS

TONIGHT, BLUE LIGHTS SHINING IN YOUR EYES
AND I'M DROWNING IN YOUR EYES
TONIGHT, BLUE LIGHTS SHINING IN YOUR EYES
AND I'M DROWNING IN YOUR EYES
DROWNING IN YOUR EYES

YOU WERE SO KIND TONIGHT
BUT I JUST COULDN'T SAY WHAT I DESIRED
I JUST KEPT YOU IN SIGHT
AND THEN I JUST SANG A LOVE SONG TO YOU

IS THIS LOVE TRUE LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IS THIS HOW IT FEELS

TONIGHT, I AM FALLING, FALLING SO
DEEPLY IN LOVE
I'M DROWNING IN YOUR EYES

I'M FALLING DEEPLY, DROWNING
DEEPLY IN YOUR EYES

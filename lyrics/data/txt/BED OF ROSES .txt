Oh here it comes again...pain
The one I felt before...always the same
I ryt to escape but it's always there
Calling, clawing, waiting everywhere I go

Oh here it comes again
And through my bitter heart it spreads
Warm is the hold, cold is the kiss

I just don't know what it's all about
All my life I spent to heal

We burn on a bed of roses
See the pain release it's flames in cinnamon and gold
We burn on a bed of roses
It cuts our hearts...with the sweetest sound

I just don't know what it's all about
All my life I spent to heal

We burn on a bed of roses
See the pain release it's flames in cinnamon and gold
We burn on a bed of roses
It cuts our hearts, cuts apart
We burn on a bed of roses
See the pain release it's flames in cinnamon and gold
We burn on a bed of roses
It cuts our hearts...with the sweetest sound

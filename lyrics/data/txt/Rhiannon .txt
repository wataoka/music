Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in fight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never known
Woman, taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised to you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless

Once in a million years
A lady like her rises
Rhiannon you cried, but then
She's gone
And your life knows no answers
Baby your life knows no answers

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

Once in a million years
A lady like her rises
Rhiannon you cried, but then
She's gone
And your life knows no answers
Baby your life knows no answers

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

Taken by
Taken by the sky
Taken by
Taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a stage of mind

Take me with the wind baby
Take me with the sky
Take me like the wind baby
Take me with the sky

All the same
All the same
All the same
Rhiannon

And won't you take me with you to the sky
All the same
All the same
All the same
Rhiannon
Won't you take me with you to the sky

Dreamers
Drivers
You gotta leave her

Everything now ruhlessly torn apart
All the things ones I had are gone
Can't you hear,the dark blades of the night
Craving for that wound you'll bleed

Lost of all tears
My sight blinded of faith
Lost voices call in pain
(but)nothing answers

Still I remember
(and)Still I see yeah
Awoken in the scorched out land of grief
And yet something grows within

Stretch out,egnite the light
Can I still believe?
the Amber Sunset
the brown soil lullabys
Green leaves on your skin
Still I see

White morning lights
the soothing of noon breeze
silence of the stars filled the nights
now shatterd to pieces

Still I remember
(and)Still I see yeah
Breathing the sound of life
Reviving the truth someday
even through blinded eyes

Still I remember
(and)Still I see yeah
spawning the world with light
hear the sound come to life
even through blinded eyes
Still I see

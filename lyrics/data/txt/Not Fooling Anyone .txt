All those crazy things you said
Spinning around inside my head
Did I deserve to get all that?

There you go
Putting on another show
And you don't even know

How you are
In their eyes and in their ears
You look so insecure and insincere
Just the way I know you've always done

And now you're
In the way and in this shit
Because you're incomplete and indiscreet
And you're just not fooling anyone

Now and again I hear from you
Telling me what I need to do
Though you don't really have a clue

There you go
Putting on another show
And you don't even know

How you are
In their eyes and in their ears
You look so insecure and insincere
Just the way I know you've always done

And now you're
In the way and in this shit
Because you're incomplete and indiscrete
And you're just not fooling anyone

Now you're not fooling anyone

Constantly searching - still can't find
Ever illusive - peace of mind
Sometimes it's near - but slips away
And I'm faced with anofher day

☆Of wanting you - to just be near
　To feel your breath upon my ear
　Of wishing you would call my name
　'Cause only you can light the flame

Desperately wanting - just to sleep
But there's no rest when - my soul you keep
And I cry out - oh Lord I pray
Don't make me face another day

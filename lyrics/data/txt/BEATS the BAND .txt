Keep my temper, cool off,
Keep my tension, heat on.
I don't mind showing my colors,
Any yesterdays, any tomorrows,
I make no bones about them.
No desire to go on with you,
nobody can get it's confirmation.
I wanna be me, I wanna be free,
I don't be to ask for the moon.

And I take a beauty sleep
until evening comes.
Then everything is ready for me.
I don't shuffle on the street,
refinement is mine.
Nobody can get the jump on me.
Outdoing myself is my way.

And I play with paradox
until it's boring
Then I can be ready for beating.
I do stride on the street,
refuse all mercy.
Nobody can get the jump on me.
Outdoing myself always feeds my soul,
feeds my soul.

Every day and night, every situation,
I know what I am doing there.
Any conversation,
any fantasies can not keep turning me on.
Even make a deal with me today,
nobody can get it's confirmation.
I don't dress to kill, still I bedevil.
I don't want a bed of roses.

And I take a beauty sleep
until evening comes.
Then everything is ready for me.
I don't shuffle on the street,
refinement is mine.
Nobody can get the jump on me.
Outdoing myself is my way.

And I play with paradox
until it's boring
Then I can be ready for beating.
I do stride on the street,
refuse all mercy.
Nobody can get the jump on me.
Outdoing myself always feeds my soul,
feeds my soul.

And I take a beauty sleep
until evening comes.
Then everything is ready for me.
I don't shuffle on the street,
refinement is mine.
Nobody can get the jump on me.
Outdoing myself is my way.

And I play with paradox
until it's boring
Then I can be ready for beating.
I do stride on the street,
refuse all mercy.
Nobody can get the jump on me.
Outdoing myself always feeds my soul,
feeds my soul.

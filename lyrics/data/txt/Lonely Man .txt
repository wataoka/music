Once again you're on your own
Lonely man, nobody can
Reach through your shell, to know you well
And give you Light, where there is night
In the city

Once again, once again, you're on your own
Who's to blame, who's to blame, it's such a shame
No-one ever hears your name, or plays your game

You'll live your life all alone
There's no other way that you can go
But to live each day as you can
Make of it my friend, lonely man

Baby, baby, watch a what you're doing

Once again you're on your own
Another place, another face
But the lights, like neon eyes
Can take you out, out of the crowd's
In the city

Once again, once again, you're on your own
Who's to blame, who's to blame, it's such a shame
No-one knows just who you are, man where's your star

You'll live your life all alone
There's no other way that you can go
But to live each day as you can
Make of it my friend, lonely man

Baby, baby, watch a what you're doing

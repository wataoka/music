She's a ballerina
A story about her freedom

She does the flip
And then she does the turn
She concentrates as she raises her arms slowly

Her eyes are set to the audience
The music starts; it's time to dance
So move your feet to the beat
Just move your feet and dance

The world turns like a renverse
朝がまた来る 今日も頑張るぜ

Life's like a promenade
どんな時もあきらめないで

Develope and elevate
新たな何かが待ち受けている

She's a ballerina
A story about her freedom
Day to day 特訓の成果を感じて
そしていつの日か grand jete

Takes her leap to the world

世界に羽ばたけ

Take one step back and catch your breath
Raise your right arm and bend
Your wrist and point it to the left
Then you lift your right leg

Bend your right knee so that
It is facing the right-hand side
Now bring your left hand to your chest and then
You say, “Shake!” (シェー!)

She will be dancing for the world
She is a one beautiful girl

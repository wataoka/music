I remember when I was a boy
I was really nervous 'bout playing the music
Sitting on a chair and close my eyes
Fingers opened, then I touched black and white keys

Loneliness, broken heart
All emotions of my youth glowed up with these notes
It always echose inside

So will you keep on singing loud
Until the day your voice is gone
That I can follow your sign
Even if music stops and the silent blinds my world

I lived in a small world in my mind
It was really bright and rich imagination
Waited for the savior of my youth
There was nothing I can do without your help

Loneliness, broken heart
All emotions of my youth glowed up with these notes
It always echose inside

So will you keep on singing loud
Until the day your voice is gone
That I can follow your sign
Even if music stops and the silent blinds my world

So will you keep on singing loud
Until the day your voice is gone
That I can follow your sign
Even if music stops and the silent blinds my world

So I will keep on rocking the night
If there's no music, I'll be wreck
This is my dearest life line
There's nothing else that I can trust and feel the worth

I remember when I was a boy
I was taking a trip alone around my world

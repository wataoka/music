If a small thing could change this whole world
I thought I could get back what I had lost
To cry tears one time is enough for a single emotion
Cause I know regrets will amount to nothing

Till my feet do not move anymore
I made my decision to brace and bear all wounds
But it's only your smile I wish to see in the end

Even if my emotions shoot out from my body it circles around the world
And comes back ready to burst any second now
As I raised my voice saying what I can't make into words
I kept running until the break of dawn and sunrise

That carefree smile of yours
That slightly low strong voice
Always taken by your hard firm eye
And dignified ways

The bell rang many times
But still could not get there
Though you stayed there for me
Trusted me

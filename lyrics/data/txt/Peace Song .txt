A little girl was crying
Under the darkest sky
She was just like me
And the time has just gone by
Nobody knows why we turn away
From all disaster
But we live in our lives
Believing in our joy and laughter

We are standing on a beautiful world
We are standing on a beautiful world

It's too early to give up
Because we're here to be loved
“Love and peace”
It's not too late
We can start it over again

We are standing on a beautiful world
We are standing on a beautiful world

It's too early to give up
Because we're here to be loved
“Love and peace”
It's not too late
We can start it over again

Everything now ruthlessly torn apart
All the things once I had are gone
Can't you hear,the dark blades of the night
craving for that wound you'll bleed

lost of all tears
my sight blinded of faith
lost voices call in pain
(but) nothing answers

Still I remember
(and) Still I see (yeah)
Awoken in the scorched out land of grief
And yet something grows within

Stretch out,ignite the light
Can I still believe?
the Amber Sunset
the brown soil lullabies
Green leaves on your skin

Still I see (Still I believe)

white morning lights
the something of noon breeze
silence of the stars filled the nights

now shattered to pieces (all are but memories)

Still I remember
(and) Still I see (yeah)
breathing the sound of life
reviving the truth someday
even through blinded eyes

Still I remember
(and) Still I see (yeah)
spawning the world with light
hear the sound come to life
even through blinded eyes

Still I see
Still I believe

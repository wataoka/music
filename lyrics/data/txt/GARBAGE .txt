As dark as dark sky and earth,dizzily mind
As sore as sorethe back of the gullet,dizziness

You can't catch me,can't catch me
Can blind birds fly?They can't

I go up the blind stairs intently
I go up the blind stairs intently
I go up the blind stairs intently
I go up the blind stairs intently

(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen,time is over
(Ladies andgentlemen)
Ladies andgentlemen,please die
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen,time is over
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen, please die

排水溝に流れてゆく俺の子供は無能な欠片
俺の手じゃ何も掴めない

Like a garbage I go back to doing

Whatever I may wish,it's weed life
Whatever I may wish,it's weed life

Whatever (Whatever)I may (I may) wish,it's weed life

Night and day at the end of the day,
all day and so every day
夢さえも叫ぶさI want to become happy

(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen,time is over
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen,please die
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen,time is over
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Ladies and gentlemen,please die

薔薇色真っ赤な口笑う俺の子供は無能な欠片
自虐… 虐待… 死ね…忘れたい… 大嫌い…
花びらゲームの数え唄

Like a garbage I go back to doing
Like a garbage I go back to doing
please die

Just a pleasant holiday
With nothin' that I gotta do
Finished up my laundry
Hummed a lazy tune.
With a funny melody
A happy ordinary day
Can't you see my heart is beating 1,2,3

la la la la la....
la la la la
la la la la la....
la la la la

Feels so good to be alive,
Everyday gets better when you dance with life.

la la la la la....
la la la la
la la la la la....
la la la la

Take a shower of pure sunlight,
Everyday gets better when your dance is life.

The world beats out a rhythm for you and me.
The world beats out a rhythm for you and me.
The world beats out a rhythm for you and me.
The world beats out a rhythm for you and me.

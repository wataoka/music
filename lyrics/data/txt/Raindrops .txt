I am lying You are lying
We keep our backs turned away
You are hiding but I'm not looking
You wonder if I'm still there

You are cheating 'Cause I am cheating
We know that but we're still pretending We're still pretending

You're right I'm no good You're no angel too
Let's see if we can find an easy way out

I am not sad You're not sad
We're getting further everyday
We need to cut the bond tyin' us
or we're gonna lose our breath Here we go my dear

You're right I'm no good You're no angel too
Let's see if we can find an easy way out
We are just raindrops falling through the sky
All we do is wait until the splash

All your goodness is gone now
Unbearable sweetness too
Our memories won't remain We went on too long

All your love all your hate all your hesitation
all your kisses all your touches but a shadow of the past

You're right I'm no good You're no angel too
Let's see if we can find an easy way out
We are just raindrops falling through the sky
All we do is wait until the splash Here we go my dear

Walking down the street he bounces everywhere he goes
All the people stop and look - he's happy and it shows
Captain of his confidence, he's cool and calm and tough
Everyone can count on him whenever things get rough

Now, you can see how -
He's the leader we've been waiting for time to go.
The countdown's on, let's start it now...

1 2 3 4 5
Get ready for the“one two”
No matter what the future holds for you
You will find your own freedom
In your own way of living
And happiness in everything you do
Downtown Dance

Why do they say everyone should go at the same pace
When we find our own beat that's when we will win the race
Now, you can see how - to feel the confidence in you
Listen: Now get ready for the countdown

6 7 8 9 10
Take aim for the“one two”
Just take your problems, put them behind you
All we need is each other
We can never say“never”
It's better with a brighter attitude

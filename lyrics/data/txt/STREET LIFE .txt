I still hang around, neither lost nor found
Hear the lonely sound of music in the night
Nights are always bright That's all that's left for me, yeah

I play the street life because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life, and there's a thousand parts to play
Street life, until you play your life away

You let the people see just who you wanna be
And every night you shine just like a superstar
That's how the life is played, a ten cent masquerade
You're dressed, you walk, you talk, you're who you think you are

Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel or a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Street life, or you're gonna feel the cold

There's always love for sale, a grown-up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young, your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon

Street life (4x)

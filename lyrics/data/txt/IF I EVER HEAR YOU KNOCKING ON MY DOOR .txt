When I hold you tight you belong to me…
Oh oh, my love is yours
oh oh, each time there's more

Sentimental girl, let me make you feel so right
Oh oh, deep in my heart,
oh oh, I hear you cry

Watch our love grow 'cause it's for two
Oh oh, Why do we love each other blue?
Oh oh, Don't ever ask if it's wrong or it's right

You'll never know how it means oh so much to me,
If I ever hear you knocking on my door

Where are you tonight? You belong to me
Oh oh, what can I do,
oh oh, waitin' for you

Ballerina girl you can dance with me
Oh oh, safe in my arms,
oh oh, you'll find no harm

Watch our love grow 'cause it's for two
Oh oh, Why do we love each other blue?
Oh oh, Don't ever ask if it's wrong or it's right

You'll never know how the dream would come back for me,
If I ever hear you knocking on my door

I'm wonderin' when you might come back to me
You'll find it true that we'll live happily

You don't know how I'd love you all of the time,
If you'd only be mine, always be mine

Watch our love grow 'cause it's for two
Oh oh, Why do we love each other blue?
Oh oh, Don't ever ask if it's wrong or it's right

You'll never know what a joy it would be tonight,
If I ever hear you knocking on my door,

Mm… If I ever hear you knocking on my door

yeah…

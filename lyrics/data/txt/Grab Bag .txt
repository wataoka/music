Oh,love,lip,kisses,

oh I gatta easy habit learn it,move it,caught up baby,got it,shopping,

今のlife 今のway
I'm like a knife, no way
今のまま or another way
これからの new days
今のlife 今のway
I'm gonna go my way
I'm gonna go my way ah-

Grab bag! Chance is coming to you once only
Meanwhile you'll know I am the one and only
Im' strong 切りぬけるわ hard situations
life is filled with glorious so let's have fun now

Dance Dance
And you just come with me
Dance Dance
lets dance with me
Dance Dance
You can count on me
life is filled with glorious so let's have fun now

Make me laugh now
一緒にいたいんでしょ?
ど ど ど どう?
Hang out!!!

超HAPPY!
でもちょっと待って
冷静にThink about it
上辺着飾ってでも
Is that you?
So!

今のlife 今のway
my life is like a milky way
今のまま or another way
これからの new days
今のlife 今のway
I'm gonna go my way
I'm gonna go my way ah-

Grab bag! Chance is coming to you once only
Meanwhile you'll know I am the one and only
Im' strong 切りぬけるわ hard situations
life is filled with glorious so let's have fun now

Dance Dance
And you just come with me
Dance Dance
lets dance with me
Dance Dance
You can count on me
life is filled with glorious so let's have fun now

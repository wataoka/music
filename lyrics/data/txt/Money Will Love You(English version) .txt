Do you realize that you've been living this way?
Going to parties, and waking up late in the day
You don't take advantage of the game that you play
You don't disagree when you hear them say;
It's a cold world, but I don't mind the scene,
And it's a cold, cold city, but a home to me
There's a wild adventure that appears in your sleep,
but don't you worry
Money with love you

Do you realize that you've come this far?
From a far east village, now you're a star
You're destined to discover, maybe today
Some sweet lover, a dream, or a Saint
Oh it's a cold world, but I don't mind the scene,
And it's a cold, cold city, but a home to me
There's a wild adventure that appears in my sleep,
but don't you worry
Money will love you

So hold out your hand, there's so much to take
Pick up the pieces, along the way
Take on the world, maybe today
Now we are golden
Money will love you

『なんて冷たい世界 それでもいい
なんて冷たい街 だけど自由
冒険はいつも夢の中 でも
心配はない それも愛のうち』

So hold out your hand, there's so much to take
Pick up the pieces, along the way
Take on the world, maybe today
Now we are golden,
Money will love you, somebody will love you,
No, somebody already loves you.

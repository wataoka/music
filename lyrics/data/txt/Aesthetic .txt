Longing for you day and in dream
I'm hoping you are here and leading my way
You steers my road anytime I need
If you walk away, I will follow you 

Trying my life
With your sacred gifts you gave to me
I wonâ€™t vain and succeed it as your precious soul
Holding your hand
And I'm walking through the all of the world
Carrying your wish like the Venus in the dim sky

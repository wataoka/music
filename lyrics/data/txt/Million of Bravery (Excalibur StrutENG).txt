Don't know why. I don't know why. Don't know why.
I cannot even control myself.
To the sky whose color is dirty mud
Now the time! Release your light!

“What a terrible destiny!”
“Everything's been already made”.
“How pitiful I am, my Gosh!”
OK…you are the jerk.

Being stronger and stronger.
That is the only way to live.
Brand new scars are left on my skin.
I can smile at the scarlet red.

I cannot see, but I wanna see.
However I'm getting lost among the darkest forest.
Bravery!!(Owe to myself!!)

I'm big enough to betray my destiny.
With the strength, I beat the outrageous moment.
(My holy sword wii never rust)
Lose precious things, and you can get higher!
Don't you be afraid.
(Forever and ever. Deeper and deeper)
Stronger, Huger:Bravery!!

You always say to me
“I'm living for neighborhood”
You love yourself more than others.
Hey boy, can you deny?

If you want it eagerly,
You should be like an animal.
How can you rescue anyone
though you cannot rescue yourself.

Darkness is illusion.
You're just shutting your eyes.
Everything depends on yourself.
Bravery!!(My life is mine!!)

I, a creature will disappear from this world.
I will go back to the soil: the mother earth.
(fly away from the body that someone made)
While you're alive, you should engrave your life to the history.
(Forever and ever. Deeper and deeper)
Stronger, Huger:Bravery!!

You want me to get away from the world?
Hate me! Hate me! Please do hate me.
Sorry boy, your dream never comes true.
My strength get bigger and bigger.

Don't know why. I don't know why. Don't know why.
I cannot even control myself.
To the sky whose color is dirty mud
Now the time! Release your light!

I'm big enough
I'm huge enough to betray my destiny.
With the strengh, I beat the outrageous moment.
(My holy sword wii never rust)
Lose precious things, and you can get higher!
Don't you be afraid.
(Forever and ever. Deeper and deeper)
Stronger,Huger: Bravery!!

Stronger,Huger: Bravery!!

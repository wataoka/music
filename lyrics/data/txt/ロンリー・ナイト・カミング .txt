When I feel these lonely nights comin'
These lonely heart-breaking nights
I want to sit and forget
For it was just a little ago
That I thought I found
The one true love

赤い夕陽かがやく
燃える浜辺に うかぶ面影
僕の愛を捨てて
君はなぜほほえむ

When I feel these lonely nights comin'
These lonely heart-breaking nights
I want to sit and forget
For it was just a little ago
That I thought I found
The one true love

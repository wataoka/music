All alone-I see you standing there
With nothing left to show me but your tears
Feeling sad-What can you do?

Take a chance. You're gonna need someone
To make you smile and chase away your fears
Count on me-I care for you

If you give your heart-
And put your trust in me
If you give your heart-
I'll try my best to be
Everything you wanted and more
It's you I adore
Don't be afraid to try

If you give your heart-I'll give it all to you
If you give your heart-
I'll make your dreams come true
I would give you the world-
If you'd only give your heart

Take my hand and walk along with me
Love will be beside you all the way
So believe these words I say

If you give your heart-
And put your trust in me
If you give your heart-
I'll try my best to be
Everything you wanted and more
It's you I adore
Don't be afraid to try

Give me a chance to always guide you
Everywhere you may go
And I will be there for you-Whatever you do
That's one thing you should know

If you give your heart-I'll give it all to you
If you give your heart-
I'll make your dreams come true
I would give you the world-
If you'd only give your heart
I would give you the world-
If you'd only give your heart

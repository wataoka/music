There may not be an answer to this too,
why the sky is blue, is the change in me all true?
Now that you are next to me,
I have no fears and all I know is that I want to be with you

Sometimes it's easy to forget the times we weep,
the moment makes us weak, and all the shame I see
Memories exist for all the precious days my heart still wants to keep,
somewhere deep inside of me

A Lullaby For You
Don't you worry baby, I'll be here by your side
May tomorrow be wonderful too
Close to you I hope to stay, endlessly from today
Even through cloudy days you are not alone

Sweet dreams I do not see cause darkness scares me,
is it because I'm still fifteen, Or the loneliness in me
Wish I may I wish I might sleep soundly through the windyy nights,
just to dream of you tonight

A Lullaby For You
Stars will always gracefully watch over 'till it's bright
May tomorrow be wonderful too
Take my hand promise me, that we'll be all right
Finding a place to feel at home you are not alone

Maybe I'll turn back to stay
Where I came from only yesterday
Whisper then,"The past is gone eternally"

A Lullaby For You
Don't you worry baby, I'll be here by your side
May tomorrow be wonderful too
Close to you I hope to stay, endlessly from today
Even through cloudy days you are not alone

She lives by fake slide away
She always sleep off her pain
It's fate to be weed head
She takes my fakes smile away
She may or may not come
It's fate to be weed head

Looking for ‘A'
Looking for ‘ape'

I'm animal
I'm animal
I'm animal
Rits, anymore

She makes perfect finally
But she is in great need
It's fate to be weed head
She talks with her family
But she likes living alone
It's fate to be weed head

Waiting for ‘E'
Waiting for ‘eve'

I'm animal
I'm animal
I'm animal
Rits, anymore

Shooting the ‘J '
Shooting the ‘jail'

I'm animal
I'm animal
I'm animal
Rits, anymore

It's fate to be weed head

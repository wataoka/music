You lose your mind, you crash
A nervous breakdown
You feel an urge inside, you crush
There's no escape now

You try to change your life, you jump
Another letdown
But then you hear a voice inside
You gotta open up your vision
See the life bestowed on you

Blinded by reality
Broken ideology
Heart in captivity
Hold on
Exceeding the borders within

Seize your capability
Endless possibility
Find your individuality
Take pride, let the chase begin

Don't tell me what direction you think I should take
(I know I'm gonna find the way)
Don't tell me that this sable is for my own sake
(Hear what I've got to say)
Don't tell me to believe the decisions you make
(I'm facing a new day)
So open up your blinded eyes
Stop living a lie and start living your life

My way or no way
Today you're falling away My way or no way
Today I'm breaking away

You need a sign, you search
You're burning out
Your heart is run down
A system shut down
All you want is to face the fatal error
You'll never backdown
'Cause it's now that you know the time is right
You gotta lead a revolution
Believe the only light in you

Look now, my sweetest fantasy is blinding your reality
I'm breaking down the walls surrounding
your ridiculously boring ideology
First chance, you let it slip away
One chance, you don't want to throw away
Fate is turning, returning to you square one
Get set and the game begins

Don't tell me that I'm making another mistake
(I know I'm gonna find the way)
Don't tell me that I'll end in another heartache
(Hear what I've got to say)
Don't tell me that today is already too late
(I'm facing a new day)
So open up your blinded eyes
Stop living a lie and start living your life

Not everything is always what it seems
But there are things beyond what you could see
It doesn't mean that all the critical things are lost
It doesn't take defiance to be heard
You never needed the anger to move on
All you need is the will to hold on

Last chance
Take it or leave it
Nothing begins if you don't see it
This is how your life goes

Don't tell me what direction you think I should take
(I know I'm gonna find the way)
Don't tell me that this sable is for my own sake
(Hear what I've got to say)
Don't tell me to believe the decisions you make
(I'm facing a new day)
So open up your blinded eyes
Stop living a lie and start living your life

My way or no way
Today you're falling away My way or no way
Today I'm breaking away

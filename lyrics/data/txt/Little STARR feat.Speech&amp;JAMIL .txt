Hah Ah Little STARR
眩しすぎて君の瞳 見つめられないよ
You are my Little STARR
このサングラスごと溶けてしまいそう

一目見た時から ドンピシャっ!
ドキドキは 恋の扉 暢気な俺はどうした?
まるで初心者マークの青二才
住む世界が違えど 誘導された君と
どうか エボリューション
半信半疑の御単身 何とか言ってくれよ JAMIL

We don't stop for fad or fashion
when we get in this game
We just rapping for the passion
and wish it were the same
in the end time is money でも金じゃね
so put  your heart spit fire and you can feel the flame
this aint def
I can hear clearly
through building, see the sky through the ceiling clearly
limitless, just like my vision is
but it's me, my base, my soul my peace

Hah Ah Little STARR
眩しすぎて君の瞳 見つめられないよ
You are my Little STARR
このサングラスごと溶けてしまいそう

Yeah Yeah
it's the triple threat of rap
don't really matter where you gonna go
spin the globe and youll hear our songs
Oh Oh
I see y'all in the crowd yea
just give me the strength to keep move on

Everywhere I toured used to carry my wax
But now Stick up kids they like to tax.
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
With me there is no answered to that.
I'm like Doug E.
Fresh and the ladies love me. Like LL
And ill Battle anybody I don't care if you tell.
Classic hits like k-tel y'all pick em
Brrr stick em ha ha ha stick em

いつかは君と二人のステージ
向かう助手席に君乗せて 今はまだSTAY
お決まり 臭ぇ~言葉用意しとくぜ
君のSweet Spot 打込む一撃Nice Shot
好き狙ってるっしょ? だから待ってて
君をソリューション 照準 今君にリブート

Hah Ah Little STARR
just watching you that is true and stays with me
it gives me power
You are my Little STARR
you always find a way to brighten up in my world

こんなに傍にいるのに くっつかないストーリー
君への想いはいずこに
気付いて欲しい 君は僕を輝かせるSTARR

Someone say my name
It's feels sublime, feeling the rhyme
and I pathed the way

I'm a beast on the one and two's plus a mic too.
Never know just what I might do.

飽和状態 Heart Beat カッ飛び さぁ今 一番乗り

And then no way to the end
just find your star and never let it go again

Hah Ah Little STARR
You aint gota be famous aint gotta be known
Ill handle all that just be here and know that
You are my Little STARR
申し分無いぜ 自分次第で君と描ける 自由自在GAME

Hah Ah Little STARR
眩しすぎて君の瞳 見つめられないよ
You are my Little STAR
このサングラスごと溶けてしまいそう

Yeah Yeah
it's the triple threat of rap
don't really matter where you gonna go
spin the globe and youll hear our songs
Oh Oh
I see y'all in the crowd yea
just give me the strength to keep move on

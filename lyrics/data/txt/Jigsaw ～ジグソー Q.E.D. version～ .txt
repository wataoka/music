Humans full of their greed Make on sacrifices
Giving's never a deed They want more than they need
Humans are so sinful Acts like they love justice
Hold grudge against the others They hold none for themselves

Forfeit a blessed life You threat to take your life
Waste blood to drag people's eyes (But) Hesitate to follow through
Not knowing life as a matter A child conceiving another
Conceiving just to smother How can you still stay alive?

If you're alive now,
tell me your voice, your truth.
If you are not lying‥‥

I'm dreaming a nightmare Can it be that your love is for yourself
Tell me that I am wrong
I'm dreaming a nightmare your love's not for the ones you say you love
Admit it, it's for yourself

Humans they are all weak They hate going through pain
Don't love, you only feign To justify their misdeeds

For the weak you claim to fight But the cry is just a guise
Your own sins you just deny Who are you to judge a crime?
You lecture animal rights (And) Consume their flesh in delight
For Earth you'd put up a fight (But) Harm from burning never ends

I'm dreaming a nightmare Can it be that your love is for yourself?
Tell me that I am wrong
I'm dreaming a nightmare You just love yourself acting like the good
Tell me that I am wrong

I want to play my game Can you sacrifice your soul, fame and pride?
In the name of justice
I want to play my game Can you sacrifice love for righteousness?
Are you not so sure now?

That's what makes humans so weak

If you're alive now,
tell me your voice, your truth.
If you are not lying‥‥

I'm dreaming a nightmare Can it be that your love is for yourself
Tell me that I am wrong
I'm dreaming a nightmare Your love's not for the ones you say you love
Admit it, it's for yourself

I want to play my game Can you sacrifice (your) future, soul and gold?
For the ones that you love
I want to play my game Can you stand for love?
As you turn your back, back against righteousness

I know I can't, I'm only human

We couldn't say them
now we just pray them
Words that we couldn't say

Funny ain't it
games people play
scratch it, paint it
one in the same

We couldn't find them
we tried to hide them
Words that we couldn't say

It hurts don't it
fools on parade
taint it, own it
chase it away

We couldn't make them
we had to break them
Words that we couldn't say

Sometimes baby
we make mistakes
dark and hazy
prices we pay

I sit here on my shelf
talking to myself
Words that we couldn't say

Someday, maybe
we'll make it right
until that day
long endless nights

We couldn' t say them
now we just pray them
Words that we couldn't say

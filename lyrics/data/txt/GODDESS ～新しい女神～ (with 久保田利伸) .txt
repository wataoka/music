Sha... Shall we ride ? Let's ride together to our promised land
Sha... Shall we ride ? Wanna make my wishes come true

Something different is in the air,
it's like listening to a brand new sound
U came into my empty heart and my oh my
I can feel my heart beat faster
It's not the indigo sky that's bright,
the reasons everything seems so clear
Not even if I gathered all the light in the world
I can show you how I feel

Longing for u every night in my dreams...
Hoping somehow that this thing can be real...

Sha... Shall we ride ? Wanna wake up laying next to u
Sha... Shall we ride ? Gonna send u all my million tender kisses
Sha... Shall we dance ? Wanna feel your every single move
Sha... Shall we dance ? Gonna give u all my love

All it takes is just one look u make me cross my borderline
I won't let nobody break me down
or shake me down this feeling's so true
What u're feeling I'm feeling too... I can c the future we can have
Let's make all our dreams and wishes come true
in this time that we have right now

Wishing that somehow the seasons can bring...
Dreaming â€˜bout u makes the reasons so clear...

Sha... Shall we ride ? Longing for u, I wanna embrace
ShaShall we ride ? And like the gentle waves I won't forget
Sha... Shall we dance ? Let's ride together to our promised land
Sha... Shall we dance ? Wanna make my wishes come true

Won't stop this healing
Can't stop this feeling

Sha... Shall we ride ? Wanna wake up laying next to u
Sha... Shall we ride ? Gonna send u all my million tender kisses
Sha... Shall we dance ? Wanna feel your every single move
Sha... Shall we dance ? Be the goddess in your mind !

Sha... Shall we ride ?
Sha... Shall we ride ? (I just saved my love 4 u)
Sha... Shall we dance ? Wanna feel your every single move
Sha... Shall we dance ? (I just saved my love 4 u)

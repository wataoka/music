Going to live by yourself
I am feeling alone
I have to love, loving myself

No longer even I know
Wondering walking around
Looking myself for an answer

In the wildness decorated with surface
It is bloom on earth with dignified on earth
A beautiful flower

Oh I wanna be I wanna be like a flower
Oh I saw a flower call it "nameless"

When you are starting something new
I am looking for that
I must know we need courage

If you can forever be
Let me stay by your side
It will lead for the tomorrow

Lonely nights I counted star in the sky
It is healing by the clean smile you will give
And lighting up the sky

Oh I wanna be I wanna be like a flower
Oh I wanna make bloom it in my heart

We can scoop our happiness with both of hands
God is gave us all so fairly with compassion
We will find ourselves with happiness and can keep it from the darkness?

Oh I wanna be I wanna be a beautiful flower
Oh it will may bloom flower in your mind

Oh I wanna be I wanna be like a flower
Oh I saw a flower call it "nameless"

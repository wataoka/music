If you got the beats
I got the feet
Got the appetite
For some breakdown summit

Of all the flock
He's a chip off the block
Caught in a vis-a-vis
With a def jam turkey

They've got ya fooled
He's just a phony
He's a busy bee
With no honey for me

If you're never down
It's because you don't know
It's just that...

na na na na na...

Let me hear you now!

Who's back on the town
Caught you goin' to have some fun
I said who's back on the run
Got to hurry up
Gotta got my gun
I said who's back dealin'some
Got to load up
Gotta get my run
I said who's back on the run
They got ya goin' down

Word on the street
We're in defeat
Without retreat
Goin' down for the long one

Eyes at 9
He's in the trees
Doesn't even see me
Make my move
He's goin' down now

When you gotta chose
With no stakes to lose
Better bet another chip
And watch you're money flush down

If you never dance
It's because you don't know

It's just that...

na na na na na...

Let me hear you now!

Who's back on the town
Caught you goin' to have some fun
I said who's back on the run
Got to hurry up
Gotta get my gun
I said who's back dealin'some
Got to load up
Gotta get my run
I said who's back on the run
They got ya goin' down

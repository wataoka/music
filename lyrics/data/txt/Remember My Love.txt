I wanna thank you for
all the trust and devotion
Thank you for the good times
For your love
Love as deep as any ocean
Though for a while we may go separate ways
I know nothing can come between us
Oh,No matter what people say

※Say you will remember my love
　Say you never will lose sight of
　the light we found to guide us
　Say you will remember my love
　Call me any lonely night,love
　You know I'm on your side

Well all around the world
people looking for someone
to have and belong to
Everyone
needs a love to hold on to
And when you find someone,you'll open your eyes
to the beauty that's all around you
Oh,and I'm So happy I found you,love

※Repeat

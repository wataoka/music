"WABI"often stands for apologies
And emotions all inside the Japanese
Silence, beauty, solitary life will end one day
But the world is always inside you and me

"SABI"often stands for loneliness
But it also has the meaning for"belief"
Nothing lasts, nothing ends and nothing is perfect
But the truth is always there and this word shows us the key

And we go on so incomplete
Imperfect holding vanity
But look inside yourself to notice all the beauty
I will send you words"WABI・SABI・WASABI"
And feeling all the nature where we stand

Not a rolling stone
Just like a moss-full stone
Life we bless so never dress
Your world is beautiful, yeah!!

Kids won't say this green spice tastes so good
Yes, I won't take a big bite though I should
One day when you grow up you'll confront the taste of life
With some tears, some bitter rain just like the taste of this spice

And we go on so incomplete
Imperfect holding vanity
But look inside yourself to notice all the beauty
I will send you words"WABI・SABI・WASABI"
And feeling all the nature where we stand

…on so incomplete
Imperfect holding vanity
But look inside yourself to notice all the beauty
I will send you words"WABI・SABI・WASABI"

Not a rolling stone
Just like a moss-full stone
Life we bless so never dress
Your world is beautiful, yeah!!

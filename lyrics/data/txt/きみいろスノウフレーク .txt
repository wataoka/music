Waiting for…　and I find myself wondering what you think.
Wanting to make you smile sincerely.
Ever heard the melody of love?
I would sing if I could hear you saying,
“It's wonderful, dear”

[La La La…]　Just want to promise I will be with you.
[La La La…]　You will come here surely.
[“You make me happy.”　La La La…]

Thank you for all your sweetness!
You gave me everything.　
[You gave me everything.]
Is there any way to tell you this?　
[“I wonder…my friend.”]
Please stay by my side forever and ever.　
[I'll give you everything]
Snowflakes…falling on me.　
Time to say goodbye to the old year.

We said a happy new year many times over.
Every single word you say gives me joy.
It was like time passed me by.
Such an amazing moment.
keep on singing until my dreams come true.

[La La La…]　Just want to promise　"I'll be there for you"
[La La La…]　It starts from where we are.
[“When do you feel happy?”　La La La…]

Thank you for always giving me your sweetest heart.
[You gave me everything.]
Don't be afraid of loneliness.
[“Don't worry…my friends.”]
My favorite song exists only in our world.
[I'll give you everything.]
Listen!! Can you hear me?
You're on my mind. I do care about you.

[“You make me happy.”La La La…]

Thank you for all your sweetness!
You gave me everything.　
[You gave me everything.]
Is there any way to tell you this?　
[“I wonder…my friend.”]
Please stay by my side forever and ever.　
[I'll give you everything]
Snowflakes…falling on us.　
Time to say hello to the new days.

The city sleeps cause it's a peaceful night.
I don't want to go outside tonight.
You wish you had gone away, cause over there,
There's a waterfall, that'll take you anywhere.

Cause all the walls they change around.
And all the faces around us smile.
People here are everyday people.
And when we've finally fallen down,
Your world around us turns around.
Can you really call yourself people?

Run away, I know I could never stay.
You were caving in and needed some time to go.
Run away, is there something I should say
That'll keep you here?
just know that I'm missing you.

Stop signs, seem to be controlling my life.
Telling me when I should go, or when to stop, it's all a lie.
I want to live by it all, but over there...
There's a time machine that'll take me back to when.
and how does the past return to take you back?
Only moments ago, you were 12 years old.
Innocent eyes, the key to unlock it all.
Unspoken words, the mystery to us all.
Cause all the walls they change around.
And all the faces around us smile.
People here are everyday people.
And when were finally fallen down,
Your world around you turns around.
Can you really call yourself people?

Run away, I know I could never stay.
You were caving in and needed some time to go.
Run away, is there something I should say
That'll keep you here?
Just know that I'm missing you.

The city sleeps 'cause it's a peaceful night.
I don't want to go outside tonight.

Run away, I know I could never stay.
You were caving in and needed some time to go.
Run away, is there something I should say
That'll keep you here?
Just know that I'm missing you.

I know I could never stay
Caving in
I needed time alone.
Needed to go

One morning i became really alone
when i woke up...
tears were dropping down my cheek
誰のことも信じない
哀しいことだけど

眠れない夜 I called you
opened what I thought...
偽りを脱ぎ捨てるわ

I fell in love with you
soon after we met
but I found out
We played fake love
夢見てたの
I fell in love with you
I needed you, forgive me

背中を殴る冷たい雨
bye bye baby... もう戻れない

Darling, I met you.
you had the same hurt
運命を感じていたけど
誰かの代わりにはなれないと気づいたの

あなたの優しさを思い出す
baby, you were always with me
keep in my mind

I fell in love with you
soon after we met
but i found out
We played fake love
哀しいけど
I fell in love with you
I needed you, forgive me
誰かのそばにいたかった
hey, you feel the same
to forget another one...

Baby everything should be like this
I needed you,darling... you saved me
忘れないよ Precious thing is we met
that made me grow up yeah
ah... ah...

I fell in love with you
soon after we met
but I found out
We played fake love
夢見てたの
I fell in love with you
I needed you, forgive me
心を責める冷たい雨
I fell in love with you
soon after we met
but i found out
We played fake love
哀しいけど
I fell in love with you
I needed you, forgive me
誰かのそばにいたかった
hey, you feel the same
to forget another one...

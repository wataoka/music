Every time I think “why?”
Every time I know why
It's because you said bye
I thought you were all mine
Over time I had thought
Why am I so distraught?
Seeing you in my sleep
You know that we were meant to be

If only I had wings to fly
If the sun would shine your light
Maybe I can find you
Although you're up above the sky
I know even from the ground
I'll hold your hand
Put arms around
And whisper that “I love you too”
like the last dance

“Everything is ok”
“Everything is alright”
Every time, you would say
But on that day, you lied
You told me I'm alright
You told me I'll be fine
Why did you forget to
tell me, that I'll be missing you

If only I had wings to fly
If the sun would shine your light
Maybe I can find you
Although you're up above the sky
I know even from the ground
I'll hold your hand
Put arms around
And whisper that “I love you too”
like the last dance

Every time I think “why?”
Every time I know why
It's because you're not here
Heaven's too far from here
Seeing you in my sleep
Holding you in my dreams
Wishing you were with me
Dancing like it's 2006

Just cause my silly intuition
Gives me the bold permission to believe
I must say somethin' that's been naggin'
I don't mean to be braggin'
But baby please, listen

Whoa, whoa
It should've been me that loved you
All this
It should've been me that loved you
All this time

So when you look inside the mirror
Does it get any clearer something's wrong
Does he ever go past the surface
Down where your real hurt is
Down below your pretty face

Whoa, whoa
It should've been me that loved you
All this
It should've been me that loved you
All this time

So when your heart goes what's the matter
I think I know the answer
You know it's true everything I told you baby
Whoa, whoa
It should've been me that loved you
All this
It should've been me that loved you
All this time

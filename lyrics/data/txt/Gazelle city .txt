It is very cold this morning
I slept badly sunday night
I saw my dead friend in my dream
and I was wakened by knocking

Come on, sunshine
Let's be off
Come on, sunshine
I'll walk your home
Come on sunshine
Let's be off
It's time for a change

The weather has become much warmer
I slept badly birthday night
I'm sad to leave this town
and I'm afraid it's time to say good bye

Come on, sunshine
Let's be off
Come on, sunshine
I'll walk your home
Come on sunshine
Let's be off
It's time for a change

Come on, sunshine
Let's be off
Come on, sunshine
I'll walk your home
Come on sunshine
Let's be off
(But Maybe I'm sleeping yet)

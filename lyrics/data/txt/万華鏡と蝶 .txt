Don't you know, it's too late
It's not just the dark, not even your dreaming world
You can't escape, stuck in here

Don't you know, there's no exit
You're Butterfly and lost your wings
You don't wanna be in, don't wanna be in kaleidoscope Ooh

Gotta realize, you're baby now
Gotta get it out, you're baby now
Gotta hurry up, even if you know that you can't
Even if the world makes you down
Hey, are you ready ?

Down, down, down
Can't stop falling down
It's out of my control
段々々
This world drives me mad
羽根が燃える

Can't you see, they're all gone
The beautiful wings caught in fire of desire
You're so helpless, left in there

Can't you see, it's endless world
Now you don't know, what you really want
Stay in here, oh, stay in this kaleidoscope Ooh

Gotta realize, you're baby now
Gotta get it out, you're baby now
Gotta hurry up, even if you don't know how to fly
Even if the world try to block
Hey, are you ready ?

Down, down, down
Can't stop burning out
It's out of my control
段々々
This world drives me mad
燃えて堕ちる

Gotta realize, you're baby now
Gotta get out, you're baby now
Gotta hurry up, even if you know you take a risk
That's the only way you can survive
Yes, I'm ready!!!!

Down, down, down
Can't stop falling down
It's out of my control
段々々
This world drives me mad
底無しさ

Down, down, down
I'm gonna change it
Down, down, down
I'm gonna fly out
Up and up away
Nothing can't stop me go
抜け出してやる

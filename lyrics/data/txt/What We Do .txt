Yeah it's true I've got a man
But he doesn't hold my hand
Appreciate the things I do
He must be crazy fool
Preoccupied with“what's her name”
I'll go do my thing
But I keep it on the low, no one needs to know

What's old to him is new to my baby
Two can play that game, I ain't sitting around waiting
Just relax your mind I'll deal with it later
Cause tonight's all about something new

What we do - do
It ain't nobody's business
It's true - true it is just a little secret
And oooh
It stays between me and you - what we do, what we do
It ain't nobody's business it's true

He be all up in my face
Bugging when I need space
“Who you with and where you've been?”
Man, just get over it
He can't hold it down like you never tried - not good
Double hearted thugs can't win
Well, that's too bad for him

Don't be shy tonight, Cause he be out clubbing
We have got all night, so let's do a little something, something
Just relax yourself, I'll deal with him later
Cause tonight's all about me and you

What we do - do
It ain't nobody's business
It's true - true it is just a little secret
And oooh
It stays between me and you - what we do, what we do
(×2)

Ah!! Get illy with it!!
I don't need no diamond rings
Fancy cars expensive things
I just need a man who takes control what I want he knows
How to treat a woman right, man that's true got nothing on the side
Uh uh, if I catch his ass creepin' round
Please believe I'll shut it down
If you know what I'm talking about let me hear you ladies shout -
you know what's on my mind, ain't nothing wrong with killing some time
What we do nobody gotta know uh, just keep it on the low -
yea its about me and you and we don't care about!!

What we do - do
It ain't nobody's business
It's true - true it is just a little secret
And oooh
It stays between me and you - what we do, what we do

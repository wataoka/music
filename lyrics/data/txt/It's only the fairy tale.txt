Who are those little girls in pain just trapped in castle of dark side of moon
Twelve of them shining bright in vain like flowers that blossom just once in years
They're dancing in the shadow like whispers of love just dreaming of place
where they're free as dove
They've never been allowed to love in this cursed cage
It's only the fairy tale they believe

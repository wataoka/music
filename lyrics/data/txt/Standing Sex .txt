Lucy in the sky 
I'm whisky frisky 
Lady Jane,Marry Jane 
Drive me rocked out

No pain,No delight 
Get me dry high 
Number24, 
I need X

Stand up! Fxxk up!
Show no mercy Like a lunacy

Kick off! Fxxk off!
I'm getting in the countdown

Marry Marry Kiss me Marry 
Why do you have to be ripe?

Give me Give me Give me rainy dreams 
'Til they kill me away (Lights up)

Slash Slash Let me slash
Boredom Tasteless life 

Get me Get me Get me out of the world 
'Cause I'm crying for rainy roses 
Lucy in the sky 
Get you up right
Crime of visual shock 
You are X

Stand up! Fxxk up!
Show no mercy like my jealousy
Kick off! Fxxk off!
I'm getting in the countdown 

Marry Marry Kiss me hurry
Why do you have to be ripe? 

Give me Give me Give me rainy dreams 
'Til Time kills me away (Lights up)
Marry Marry Kill me Marry 
Can't you set me free

Lady Lady Are you ready to go? 
Why do you have to be laying down?

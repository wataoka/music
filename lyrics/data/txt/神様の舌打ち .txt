The sunlight burnt the air around my window pane,
In broken dreams I feel the fear of night again,

I'm lost without a place without a home or womb,
Its empty objects now that hold me in this room.

She said shi read my eyes and danced me to the floor,
But in her shadow stood the devil at the door,

The smile that hid her life was thin and straining fast,
Her carefree movements masked the truths within her past

Just close your eyes and see what you can see
Just close your eyes and see what you can see

The sunlight burnt the air around my window pane,
In broken dreams I feel the fear of night again,

and God he clicks his tongue in a moment of silence
This tearless story unfolds while her tears roll down

Just close your eyes and see what you can see
Just close your eyes and see what you see
Just close your eyes and see what you see
Just close your eyes and see what you can be

You've left it all and now I'm feeling all the weight
It's playing out as if what's right was a mistake
You tell me how you feel you need another start
It's funny I thought that we'd never be apart

How long will it take, I can't walk alone without, you standing near me
I know you think it's kinda crazy
I meant it when I used to say…

そばにいてあげるよ
いつまででも
キミを知り尽くしたい
光と影
眩しい朝に身を委ねよう
永遠にフタリで…

If only time and nothing else world carry weight
A little more of it would help us set it straight
You blame it all on something that I didn't do
Who'd of thought that it'd be me instead of you

How long will it take, I can't walk alone without, you standing near me
I know you think it's kinda crazy
Did ya mean it when I heard you say…

そばにいてほしいよ
どんな時も
キミを知り尽くしたい
光と影
眩しい朝に身を委ねよう
そしてフタリで…

You're fadin' out you're fadin in
I'm callin' out won't let you win
恐がる事はないよ
全てはここから始まる気して

フタリの未来は 夢じゃなくて
少しづつ前に

そばにいてあげるよ
いつまででも
キミを知り尽くしたい
光と影
眩しい朝に身を委ねよう
永遠にフタリで…

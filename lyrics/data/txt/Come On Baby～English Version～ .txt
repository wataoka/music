Searching for a billion light years
For something that can fuel my desire
A place where I'll be flying
A red-hot ball of fire, yeah

Traveling, no worries or fears
Heading straight to taste something newer
Cause I want to be trying
A dynamite cool future. yeah

I got nothing in my pocket but I'm bound for her
You won't believe all the things she will do to you
It's a quickie in a rocket go around the world
This way or that way whatever you choose

Yokoso woo woo Means welcome to woo woo
Tomorrow you're moving into a grooving Japan just for you
Yokoso woo woo The future is woo woo
You're taking a jump so you can become a new version of you
Come on baby come on baby

No big deal to start a beginner
Flex and make your travel skills tighter
You're chilling like a winner
Be tough and face it fighter, yeah

You don't need to have a password or a red passport
Everyone's a stranger the first time they're meeting you
Buy an open-minded ticket, keep it in your head
First class or no class you pack what you use

Yokoso woo woo Means welcome to woo woo

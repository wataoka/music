Analyze this, it's the case about a guy
Don't give out more detail
Well…I'm not kidding,
Please tell the truth
I'm waiting for your screaming voice

Hello, turd and swine
Oh, my work keeps increasing

必ずきみの若さが軒端で漏れ出る
半泣きでキレるか普通
仰いだ陽は作りもんぽい

巷にさまよう塊よ おいで
Hello, turd and swine
Oh, my work keeps continuing

“Everyone has gone.
I hear a very sad song
Nobody understands me”
これは面倒

Analyze this, it's the case about girl
Don't give out more detail
I'm not kidding,
Please tell the truth
I wanna hear the screaming voice

巷にさまよえる魂よ
Hello, turd and swine
Oh, my work is being continued

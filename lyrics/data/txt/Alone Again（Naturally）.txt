In a little while from now.
If I'm not feeling any less sour.
I promise myself to treat myself
and visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to
Make it clear to who-
Ever what it's like when you're shattered,
Left standing in the lurch
At a church
Where people saying My God
That's tough, she's stood him up,
No point in us remaining
we may as well go home'
As I did on my own:
Alone again, Naturally

To think that only yesterday,
I was cheerful bright and gay:
Looking forward to
well who wouldn't do the role
I was about to play;

But as if to knock my down,
Reality came around:
And without so much,
As a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces:
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about
God in his mercy, who if
He really does exist
Why did he desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed 
Alone again, Naturally.

It seems to me that there are
more hearts broken in the world
That can't be mended Left unattended:
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, Naturally.
Now looking back over the years,
And whatever else that appears;
I remember I cried,
when my father died,
never wishing to hide the tears;

And at sixty five years old,
My mother God rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why
The only man
She had ever loved had been taken:
Leaving her to start
With a heart
So badly broken.
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
and when she passed away
I cried and cried all day;
Alone again, Naturally 
Alone again, Naturally.

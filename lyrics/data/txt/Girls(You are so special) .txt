You are so special, girls...
So show me your smile...

When you feel
Alone in the dark
Alone in the dark
When you're feeling down

Try to face
Up to the sky
Up to the sky
Let your heart decide

I know that you've got hurt inside
So many nights you cried and cried
It seems like never end
But you can make it through
Out of the rain
It's not a magic

1...2...3...and

Girls
Remember to be strong
Don't cling to where you belong
It is something you can try
To get along

So girls
Remember to be tough
Remember to share
All happiness with someone close
(Right beside you)
And then you will be loved

If you need
Something to ease
Something to ease
Don't you turn the key

Feel the breeze
Touching your cheeks
Caressing your knees
Fill your heart with courage

The time is running way too fast
So don't you hide behind the past
You've got to move on
No matter how it takes, how far it is
Come and believe what I say

Girls
Remember to be wise
The clues you try to find
May not always stayin' inside
Inside your mind

So girls
Just open up your heart
Remember that this world is sometimes
It is too beautiful
For you to close the door

You are so special, girls...
So show me your smile...

Girls
Remember to be strong
Don't cling to where you belong
It is something you can try
To get along

So girls
Remember to be tough
Remember to feel
All pain and tears of someone close
Remember to share
All happiness with someone close
(Right beside you)
And then you will be loved

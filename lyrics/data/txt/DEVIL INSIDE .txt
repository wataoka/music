Everybody wants me to be their angel
Everybody wants something they can cradle
They don't know I burn
They don't know I burn
They don't know I burn
They don't know I burn
(Chorus)
Maybe there's a devil (or something like it) inside
Maybe there's a devil (or something like it) inside of me
Devil (or something like it) inside
Maybe there's a devil somewhere really deep inside me
Devil inside of me
Jealous angel deep inside me
You don't know cuz you're too busy reading labels
You're missing all the action undereath my table
I'm waiting for my turn
Waiting for my turn
Just waiting for my turn
Just waiting for my turn
Chorus
Time to make it burn
This is how I burn
Chorus

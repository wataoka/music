Tonight, such a beautiful crescent moon
Changing every day, every night
Shining brighter
Just like something in our heart of bloom
Growing every dey, every night
Shining amber

Do you know when we feel like a cat, a wild cat in the cage?
We cen not miss our time, so let's find a gateway

So we gotta wake up! wake up! who we are!
We gotta wake up! wake up! our true soul...
You know we shake up! shake up! how we feel
We're crossing over the top of the season
I show you GIRLS CAN ROCK!

Somehow, feel so much with the phase of moon
Sensing each tide, each sight
Getting brighter
I have a feeling that I will meet you soon
As I feel each tide, each night
You are closer

I wanna heve somebody to hold the wild cat at the edge?
We all need the love to break through the old days

So we gotta wake up! wake up! who you are!
We gotta wake up! wake up! your true soul...
You know we shake up! shake up! how you feel
We're getting together for special reason
Now you know GIRLS CAN ROCK!

I'll rock'n roll
Like no one else
I'll rock you like never heppened...

So we gotta wake up! wake up! who we are!
We gotta wake up! wake up! our true soul...
You know we shake up! shake up! how we feel
We're crossing over the top of the season
I show you GIRLS CAN ROCK!

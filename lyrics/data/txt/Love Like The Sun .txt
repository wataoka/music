Give me kiss, big kiss, you kiss my tears away
you are the one who wears love like the sun

Give me smile, big smile, you smile my fears away
you are the one filled with love like the sun

Shiny sky, cool wind chimes with your melody
you rule my world beautifully

Yellow, red, purple, pink and blue, I can see
you rule my world brilliantly

Touch the sky, read flowers, listen to the sea
you rule miraculously

Seasons, stars, feelings, souls, go round in circles
you are the heart of my world

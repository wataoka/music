the sun goes down in the twilight
now's the time we sing along our goodbye
I hear your whisper in my dreams
from now, and on and forever

so sing my love, one more time
we never see no second time

the sun goes down in the twilight
and now's the time you kiss me
saying goodbye
but in the night I remember
the song you sang me all night long
the song of love
that shines me ever in the dark

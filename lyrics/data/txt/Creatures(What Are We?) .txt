誰のためでもなく街を彩る
雪はただ雪らしくそこに降るだけ

I'm just a foolish creature born here to dream
I could fly around the world
I'm just a foolish creature born here to dream
I could fly till the morning comes

何のためでもなく夜に浮かんだ
星はただ星らしくそこにあるだけ

こぼれたあの月の光 集めたいんだ
Not for sale
まだ見ぬ誰かの事思い描いてる(考えている)

I'm just a little creature born here to dream
I could fly to the other side
I'm just a little creature born here to dream
I could fly till the misic is over

Hey kids, watch your step.
聞こえてるだろう?
ドア叩く音が
Hey kids, watch your step
分かってるだろう?
それが誰なのか
Are you ready to grow up?
伝えたいなら all of you
Let's don't grow too fast
振り返るくらいなら all your life

We are just foolish creatures born here to dream
I could fly around the world
Hundreds of shiny stars before your eyes
I could fly till the morning comes

Where are we going? I don't know
Tic-tac-tic, it's time to say good-bye
Where are we going? I don't care
Tic-tac-tic-tac, it's time to say good-bye

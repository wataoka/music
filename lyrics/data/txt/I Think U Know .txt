I think U know 欲望のままに I think U know I think U know
I think U know 目が離せない I think U know I think U know

I think U know think U do セルカのふりで
遠慮のないパパラッチ everybody knows 消えなよ
I think U know think U do フラッシュを撒(ま)いて good bye
行き着いた先には I think U know I think U know

get it on, now 案外 見かけ倒しの shy な girl
こっちのペースに持って イケそう イケなきゃ埒(らち)もない
oh my god 派手に like it, like this

I think U know 欲望のままに I think U know I think U know
I think U know 目が離せない I think U know I think U know
I think U know I think U know

I think U know think U do キライじゃないでしょ?
君が思うよりも Lady に不自由ないし
I think U know think U do 妬かせてみたいなんて
僕を試さないで I think U know I think U know

エコカーに乗り換えなよ 環境守って恋しよう

I think U know 欲望のままに I think U know I think U know
I think U know 目が離せない I think U know I think U know
I think U know oh yeah

I think U know 欲望のままに I think U know I think U know
I think U know 目が離せない I think U know I think U know
I think U know
I think U know

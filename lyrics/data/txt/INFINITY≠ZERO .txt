There's nothing in the world to believe in
You try to break the curse you live in
この運命を 変えられるなら
Don't you let your life slip through your fingers

The clock ticks behind their lies
And their distant eyes are shouting words left unspoken
Our bitter tears are unwelcome here
純情な過去のように 忘れていくんだ
I'm so lost again
Deep down, just regret and anger

This is the chance that you've taken
Trapped in your own neglection
Your time has been moving on
答え無い人生論だろう
you'll find the way

Turn of time
(don't look away, it's a time the world could change)
Take me on
(don't let it go, there's a light that waiting)
失うことを僕は恐れずに生きて

Show me how
(don't look away, it's a time the world could change)
To go on
(don't let it go, be the light to shine on)
見えなくとも確かな心を握り締め
手を伸ばしたその先には
INFINITY≠ZERO

I'm counting the days gone by
And beneath their shadowed smiles are hearts that are broken
A time of judgement lingers near
曖昧な未来に 惑わされるんだ
Falling back again
Long gone, just pain and sadness

This is the choice that you're faced with
Blind by your own misconceptions
Your life, let it lead you on
終わりの無い理想論だろう
you'll see that fate is in your hands

When everything you've placed your faith in
Is nothing but a fading vision
These vital signs that beat within you
Will take you to the only answer
叫び続けても 届かないと知っても
僕らは今も願って...

Be the light, make a change
探してた僕ら時間を生きて

Turn of time
(don't look away, it's a time the world could change)
Take me on
(don't let it go, there's a light that waiting)
後悔の無い存在の証を握り締め
手を伸ばしたその先には
INFINITY≠ZERO

Hey oh, can you hear me call
The frequency's right, I can hear your heart
When the speaker vibrates
And we're not apart
The better things sound to me

Hey oh, baby you're not far
You're singing me songs that'll fill my heart
You're melody saves when I fall apart
Don't turn the dial on me

The white noise is your whisper
Somewhere out, your waves are on the radio
All I know is, you'll find me
My fingers, they spin the dial to take you in

And you're always on my mind though I can't see you
You take control, yeah, when I hear your voice
Do what it takes for me to keep you near me
One word is all that I need
So let me hear you say

Hey oh, can you hear me call
The frequency's right, I can hear your heart
When the speaker vibrates
And we're not apart
The better things sound to me

Hey oh, baby you're not far
You're singing me songs that'll fill my heart
You're melody saves when I fall apart
Don't turn the dial on me

Watch out for me
I'm from the big screen
Your signal is lost
Now you're staring at moi
I know disconnections are hard to revive
You pound and pound and pound, keep alive
I'm the voice in the machine keen to hypnotize
The buttons are my eyes
My ears turn the dials
I'm the good toy
For the big boys
Electronics are set to noise
Enjoy

And you're always on my mind though I can't see you
You take control, yeah, when I hear your voice
Do what it takes for me to keep you near me
One word is all that I need
So let me hear you say

Hey oh, can you hear me call
The frequency's right, I can hear your heart
When the speaker vibrates
And we're not apart
The better things sound to me

Hey oh, baby you're not far
You're singing me songs that'll fill my heart
You're melody saves when I fall apart
Don't turn the dial on me

Can you hear me ya I'm callin' up from the ground
My hands are open yeah I'm reaching out for your sound
I've lost the signal, ya you're breakin' up on me
Where are you now, I feel you somehow

Hey oh, Can you hear me call
The frequency's right, I can hear your heart
When the speaker vibrates
And we're not apart
The better things sound to me

Hey oh, baby you're not far
You're singing me songs that'll fill my heart
You're melody saves when I fall apart
Don't turn the dial on me

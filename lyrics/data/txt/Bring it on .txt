we live our life
the best we can
and not aware of some great plan we
push on
hang on

our friendships bloom
and then fade out
like cherry blossoms spin around us
in wind
ln rain

what you have is what you can lose
but i won't let that defeat me

so bring it on
i'm not afraid of crying now
because i know things work out some how
and even when life gets me down
i can still have fun
so bring it on

we'll never know
what fate will bring
and that's the mystery of living
the highs
the lows
and you can't change how winds will blow
or change the colors of the rainbow
so just let go

we can't know what we cannot see
but i still won't let that scare me

so bring it on
i'm not afraid of crying now
because i know things work out some how
and even when life gets me down
i can still have fun
so bring it on

so bring it on
i'm not afraid and i won't run
'cause i'm not alone
and i feel loved
so even though things may get tough
i know i am strong

so bring it on
i'm not afraid of crying now
because i know things work out some how
and even when life gets me down
i can still have fun
so bring it on

With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters
With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters

色あせないキッドナップミュージック
手と手が知っている
同じドアをノックしたい
この声が聞こえたら 飛び出して

With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters

With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters
With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters

はずれやすいティーンエイジ・ギア
転がる日々も
空と海と大地はただ
あるがまま いつまでも逃げないぜ

With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters
With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
With the kids sing out the future
Maybe, kids don't need the masters
Just waiting for the little Busters

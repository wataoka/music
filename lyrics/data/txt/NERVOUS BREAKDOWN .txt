From the smog filled boring life
He's looking of himself in a mirror
It's just a day Now waves are high times
Oh Rude your mind
Searchin' for just one good life
Cop him Now Ma Ma

Crazy about nervous breakdown
The aroma of outlaw
Hey Boy can't help livin' it up
Crazy for throw dance...
The aroma of outlaw
Please nowhere to drop

Sometime he stays with a glasspipe
Don't you know that midnight turn to daylight
Rubbing his eyes,
crused to dreamer will rise again
Searchin' for just one good life
Cop him Now Ma Ma

Crazy about nervous breakdown
The aroma of outlaw
Hey Boy can't help livin' it up
Crazy for throw dance...
The aroma of outlaw
Please nowhere to drop

Crazy about nervous breakdown
The aroma of outlaw
Hey Boy can't help livin' it up
Crazy for throw dance...
The aroma of outlaw
Hey Boy can't help livin' it up

So come and get up on your feet
feel the rhythm and beat the rhythm and beat
Free me! So come So come Inflame
suspicions of the quiet Common life

In the darkest place
We found that dim light
Come on brother sister
Power of the Aldnoah
Time to fight back

Conquer the earth,It's for our empire
For its plentiful water and rich air
For a seed to glow,We need fertile soil
For our children's children
Can have it all

Wipe out vermin Barbarians!
With the supreme key that we hold
Her death delivered the truth to us
All of our love,and Sorrow,Anger
The declaration of war

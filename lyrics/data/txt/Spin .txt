I know you think I'm crazy
Well, I guess I can't deny
The voice in my head
Are telling me to crash

And I'm drownin' in my own tears
My heart is empty
if it's a dream I have to open my eyes
I wanna know how long it's gonna take
Till I hit the ground

I'm falling way too fast
No time for me to speak
My days are starting to spin

My life is like a spiral
And I can't get out of this mess
I got nothing left in my hand
There's nothing more to lose

But I'm still so scared to lose myself
I'm so weak
If it's a dream I have to open my eyes
I wanna know how long it's gonna take
Till I hit the ground

Is what I've done so bad?
Or is it something I lack?
Are you not coming back?

What should I do with myself
You turned around so quickly
If there's a truth in your hands
Let me see

Just give me one good reason
How did I make you leave
I wanna hear you say it
Answer me

And I'm drownin' in my own tears
My heart is empty
if it's a dream I have to open my eyes
I wanna know how long it's gonna take
Till I hit the ground

I'm falling way too fast
No time for me to speak
My days are starting to spin

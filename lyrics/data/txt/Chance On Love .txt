My baby,what can I say
Show you the way out I feel
I just wanna be with you
Won't you give your love for me
Let's take a chance on love

あなたの腕に抱かれながら
耳もとささやいた
私をずっと離さないで
甘い夢を見せてあげるわ

Feel me,feel me
and hold me in your arms
and give a smile in my heart
I will love you everyday

Nobody does like I do
My love is so very true.
I just wanna be with you
Won't you give your love for me
Let's take a chance on love

Can't you see,I want you love
want you to tell me the same.
I just wanna be with you
Won't you give your love for me
Let's take a chance on love

いつでも恋は眠りさます
時計をかくしてる
気のない腕で抱きよせると
夢はすぐにさめてしまうわ

Feel me,feel me
and hold me in your arms
and give a smile in my heart
I will love you everyday

Nobody does like I do
My love is so very true.
I just wanna be with you
Won't you give your love for me
Let's take a chance on love

I just wanna be with you
Won't you let me stay with you
Let's give a chance on love.

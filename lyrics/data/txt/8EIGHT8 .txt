it's so wonder
dancing harder
a little creature
'cause i'm a spider

spread many cobweb
weave the world
to bring you and me
'cause i'm a spider
invisible

bloom as flower
over your head
have a good night
i'm a dreamcatcher

in the air
trap any darkness
to make you happy
a secret charmer

8 eyes 8 legs
hunting every midnight
i eat up imagined monsters inside you

i'm gonna be a scary black spider in the end
i'm gonna be lonely

8 eyes 8 legs
hunting every midnight
i eat up imagined monsters inside you

i'm gonna be a scary black spider in the end
i'm gonna be lonely

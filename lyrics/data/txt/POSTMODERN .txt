(2nd verse/Bro.Hi)
Frankly speaking a real thing is history
But it'll reborn soon…
So many kinds of community and company in this country
they believe only their means
But I think most important things is to get to know
different backgrounds and culture it's valiable factor
I'm talkin' about eternal theme

(※くり返し)

(3rd verse/Bro.Hi)
All topics for discussion
they were serious questions
Can you find“forgotten passion”?
Everybody feel this situation
One day, you broke my communication
Find out contradiction
Self distruction of Bussines
it's going around and arround…

(3rd verse/Diggy-MO')
Yo, what about music culture ?
It's getting better
For real ? I think so…
For real ? Pretty much yea,…
Had enuff! All cleared ? Not cleared
Never mind about who is tha winner
Begginer, Begginer, Hey y'all had better know that
Believer, Unbeliever, Feel this I'll give ya
Digger tha Killer quick on tha Trigger
Bigger and Better Just go tha whole figure

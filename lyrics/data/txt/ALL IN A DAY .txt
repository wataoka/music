All in a day
Can be chasing the shadows
So call it a day
See your face in the window
All in a day
Can you breathe without answer
So call it a day
Every day it makes you want it

All I've got is to die for
Will I ever be free like you
Feel like I am going out
Somethings turned me inside out

You're falling away
been fading away
You're falling away
I had to get away

You're falling away
been fading away
You're falling away
You're falling away

All you've got is to be free
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
All you've got is to be free
Bury me where I fall
Deep into the ground

All you've got is to be free

You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now

All in a day
Can you count on your fingers
So Call out a name
In between fear and sorrow
All in a day
Can you turn into a nightmare
So Call out a name
It's a day to be brand new

All these lies keep me down
Lost and found in the pouring rain
Keep on do it all again
I been waiting for so long

You're falling away
been fading away
You're falling away
I had to get away

You're craving away
been chasing around
You're craving away
Your crumbling away
You're craving away
Your gaze into the dark
You're craving away
You're craving away

All you've got is to be free
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
All you've got is to be free
Bury me where I fall
Deep into the ground

All you've got is to be free
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now

You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now
You can fade on me now

I saw you on a rainy day,
When God decreed my heart should sway,
That I should simple walk away,
It wasn't meant to be,
"I want to love you forever"
O so gorgeous what you said,
It made the tears that I had shed,
No longer matter to me.

If the phone rings twice and stops, it's
Likely to be me again

Loving, loving sweetly loving,
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you, but maybe
Crossing the street, I'll meet someone new tomorrow. For now I'm
Loving loving sweetly loving
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you, and baby
Darling darling, I can only think about you now.

Because it's not the first time, that I've fallen out of love
And after rain comes the sun, so I'll meet someone like you again.
O o o baby, it's sad but we will never see each other again.
And after rain comes the sun, I can see a blue sky above.

Champagne and strawberries all night,
And with some chocolate delight,
So dance with you then I might,
To that sweet soul music,
I'm so obliviously high,
Accepting your temptation,
You give me such a sensation,
With you I want to lose it

Important thing now is that,
You and me are together now

Loving, loving sweetly loving,
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you, but maybe
Only for now, I'll do as I please tomorrow. I'm always
Loving loving loving again
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming my dream but baby
Darling darling it's not always easy as you know

We leave the party hand in hand,
Just like a queen I'm feeling grand,
You're so much more than I demand
You know, it's just like magic.
I've gone to sleep with my make-up.
Smoked cigarettes in the teacup.
But if you're gone when I wake up,
I know it's not so tragic.

I'll never ever have to
know your name but even then

Loving, loving sweetly loving,
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you, but maybe
Waiting for you, I'll meet someone new tomorrow. For now I'm
Loving loving sweetly loving
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
Darling darling I can only think about you now.

Because it's not the first time, that I've fallen out of love
And after rain comes the sun, so I'll meet someone like you again.
O o o baby, it's sad but we will never see each other again.
And after rain comes the sun, I can see a blue sky above.

Everyday
Loving, loving sweetly loving,
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you,
Loving loving sweetly loving
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you,
Loving loving sweetly loving
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you,
Loving, loving sweetly loving
Darling darling today I'll be true

Another day
Another life
I wanna live it to the fullest
A little work
A lotta play
Alright

足跡たどり行き着く場所
なぞるだけが僕の人生じゃない
We'll never be as young as we are now

You say it's all right
You say it's OK
It's up to you? Is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feeling used with no one to save me
You say it's all right
Does that make it OK?
What's best for you
Is less for me
It's my decision

消える前 光る前 変わらない
分からないままじゃ絶対終われない
We'll never be as young as we are now

You say it's all right
You say it's OK
It's up to you? Is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feeling used with no one to save me
You say it's all right
Does that make it OK?
What's best for you
Is less for me
It's my decision

Never Never Never Never Again
It's my life my life my life my life to live

You say it's all right
You say it's OK
It's up to you? Is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feeling used with no one to save me
They say it's all right
Does that make it OK?
What's best for them
Not listening
It's my decision

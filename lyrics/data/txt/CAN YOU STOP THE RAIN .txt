Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain?

Ev'rywhere I go, I feel you there
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart
Sometimes, it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking
And there you are

Am I all alone?
Don't you ever wake up
And reach for me
Where I used to be?
Is there any chance?
I just can't believe
You're not lonely, too
Just for me and you

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain?

If you were here for only one night
Baby, I know you'd remember
'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough
I know we can make it together
Together

Baby, stop the rain
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears of mine from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you, can you stop the rain?

How can I live without you, baby?
How could I let you go?

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day

Oh, yes I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day

(ooh...) Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day
Yeah, hey, It's gonna be a bright (bright)
bright (bright) sunshiny day

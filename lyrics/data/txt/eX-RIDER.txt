You're in my eyes
Take your mind, unlock it you all know we can do it
Someday soon,
Yes, it's not too far away do you feel wind
Goin' on a drive my heart
...Drive your dream
...Drive your heart

You're in my eyes
Take your mind, unlock it you all know we can do it
Someday soon,
Yes, it's not too far away do you feel wind
Goin' on a drive my heart
...Drive your dream
...Drive your heart

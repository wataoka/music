Someone died, but I can not feel sad.
The person who died seems to be a good man.
Everyone is different from me
I know,maybe I am useless man.

I believe no one.
I need clown's make-up.

I also make only a black joke today.
Which will be a liar, I or you?
Everyone is different from me
I know,maybe I am useless man.

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll
I move like a cat, charge like a ram
Sting like a bee, babe, I wanna be your man
Well, it's plain to see, you were meant for me
I'm your boy, your twentieth century toy

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll
Fly like a plane, drive like a car
Bawl like a hound
Babe, I wanna be your man
Well, it's plain to see, you were meant for me
I'm your toy, your twentieth century boy

Twentieth century toy, I wanna be your boy
Twentieth century toy, I wanna be your boy
Twentieth century toy, I wanna be your boy
Twentieth century toy, I wanna be your boy

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll
Move like a cat, charge like a ram

Well, it' s plain to see, you were meant for me
I'm your toy, your twentieth century boy

Twentieth century toy, I wanna be your boy
Twentieth century toy, I wanna be your boy

He linked up particles and he made the world
At first he thought he didn't need to have a moon

‘Coz the night was so dark
He asked the moon to shine upon us

‘Coz things come out at night
He asked the moon to watch over all of us

So why is it that the world does not work out?
We've been thirsty forever
Give me something
So why is it that the world does not work out?
We've been hungry forever
Give me something

We felt cold so he made the sun burn hot
But we were not warmed to the depths of our hearts
So he made the sun grow and grow on and on
on the last day(the last day)everything melted away

So why is it that the world does not work out?
We've been thirsty forever
Give me something
So why is it that the world does not work out?
We've been hungry forever
Give me something

He made the moon and the sun and the star-studded sky
He made us He made us He made us and this world

We were not satisfied
We were not satisfied
We were not satisfied
We lost everything

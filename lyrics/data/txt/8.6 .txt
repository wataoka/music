On that day was the sky blue Many men didn't know it coming
A few men knew that the day don't clear Many have melted away

The city destroyed by a little mass of iron
On that day the earth burnt to the ground
The scorching sun Fighter planes high up into the sky
Screams were mixed in a smoke mushroom

nevertheless, the people lived through
the city crept up
the city lived through

The mumber 8.6 is stamped in the city
I want no more numbers fixed again
A mountain of black stiffs It was a night marish truth
I don't want it happen again

I'm proud I was born there
I'm proud I was brought up there
I like the peace and quiet of the town

There should be something I, I could do for you
There could be somethimg I, I could be for you
I've never though that I am only one
You taught me that I would be the one
For you, my friends

All the love, I got inside
All the dreams, you wish for
Hope that you hear my voice
I will sing, that is all I can do

You will be some one that you really wanna be
You don't have to hurry, you got so much time
1, 2, 3, step by step
Everything that you have done
Is going to make you happy after all
So you'll be alright, I know it for sure, you don't have to worry, no

Everyone is the same
Trying to act so strong, not to get hurt bad
Everyone should realize
It's alright to be calling out for someone
You should cry, when you feel upset
You should smile, whenever you feel good
I will be by your side, you know you're not alone

All the love, I got inside
All the dreams, you wish for
Hope that you hear my voice
I will sing, that is all I can do

Ah…I've been going through some times
Not so easy as it seems, you know how things go
I always believe myself
Now and then, forever more, I sing it's my life…dear my best friends

All the love, I got inside
All the dreams, you wish for
Hope that you hear my voice
I will sing, that is all I can do

I'll be right by you, anytime anywhere
I will sing for you, that is all I can do
For you my friends I'm gonna sing
I'll be right by you, anytime anywhere
I will sing for you, that is all I can do
I will sing for you, that is all I can do
I will sing for you, dear my best friends

明日なんて見えないくらい
落ち込んでも
いつもどおり朝はくるよ
ため息はやめて

鏡に映るションボリ顔の自分に
笑って駆け出そう

Call me up today
For your love for your love
And I will be yours
Throw your past away
With my love with my love
I know that you'll be flying high

信じるものを見失って
迷った時
足元ばかり見つづけても
道は見えないよ

空を見上げて!
光まとう天使が二人を導いてる

Call me up today
Then you'll know what I know
The power of love

Take my breath away
With your love with your love
So I could be your Angel
Fall into this love
It is fate not a fake
The potion of life
Ride the shooting star
Let it be let me be
We'll fly above the mountain high

Whenever you're alone just call my name,baby
Together we can make a miracle
Angel's comin your way to stay...

I will be your girl,a will be your girl, I will be your Angel x2

Call me up today
For your love for your love
And I will be yours

Take my breath away
With your love with your love
So I could be your Angel
Fall into this love
It is fate not a fake
The potion of life
Ride the shooting star
Let it be let me be
We'll fly above the mountain high

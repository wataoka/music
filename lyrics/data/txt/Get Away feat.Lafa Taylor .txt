We all have days when we wanna be alone
苦しい時 Turn off your cell phone
Turn up your stereo 悩んでもええ
So everybody say
Just gotta get away

When your feet feel sore
and you don't wanna walk on
今日できなかった事もあるたくさん
keep your head up stay strong
未来を信じて Everybody say
Just gotta get away

(Jamil)
I think there are 7 continents that we could go to today
And 7 consonants in (I just go-tta get a-way)
It's kinda like I'm a novelist, not running from problems
Writing the answer, I'm there I understand you
You feel like you live in the past you,
need to put those problems past you
Just 乗り越える, wanna sing any song but all that plays is the blues
Wanna switch attitudes, different socks and shoes
Dude, I wanna get away from the crowded trains
The bright city lights and the starless nights
So hey! Let me pack my things!
日が落ちるまで、がむしゃらにまっしぐらで

We all have days when we wanna be alone
苦しい時 Turn off your cell phone
Turn up your stereo 悩んでもええ
So everybody say
Just gotta get away

(Lafa)
Hey man I really hard day today,
seems like all my beautiful colors just fade to gray
I'm tring to stay sharp like a razor blade
But I ain't got no strong leaders to pave the way (follow me now)
It's hard when it seems far featched to catch a break
And I've been working so hard that I can't catch a break
I wanna chill in the park or surf and catch a break
But I've been awake since yesterday
and I haven't stopped to rest or play
You need to chill
Or your gonna get depressed,
you need to de-stress and get some deep rest
or cuddle with your girl cause she is the best
Nothing like your ladys loving cause she's the sweetest
Come girls lets escape to a tropical island,
cant wait to see you on the beach
Topless and smiling, city vibes and grey skies gonna be far away
東京から沖縄へ

We all have days when we wanna be alone
苦しい時 Turn off your cell phone
Turn up your stereo 悩んでもええ
So everybody say
Just gotta get away

(Bridge)
Caught up in the play by play
Sometimes we forget to pause
It's getting harder day by day
We gotta go against all odds
So don't worry baby
When times get tough
少しづつ now lady
gotta get back up

We gotta get away from the greed and grime
We gotta get away for some piece of mind
We gotta get away to escape to freedom
さぁ行こうか pack ya bags we are leaving
We gotta get away to inhale the fresh air
We gotta get away anyway I can get there
Gotta get away from the the same old thing
From the pain, ball and chain, the restraints of the game chea!

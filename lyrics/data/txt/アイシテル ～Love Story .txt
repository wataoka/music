Behind your sharp dark eyes
There's something pure, undefined
If I step to you, give into you. スコシズツ
The world around me fades into a dream カエレナイ
I can't escape モウハジマル

Story~アタラシイStory~
First love is now beginning
ツイニthere's truth to these words that I'm singing

Honey, won't you ride with me?
All day, everyday, anyplace, anytime
イッショニ~All through the night

アイシテル~Chapter One"アイタイ"
No tragedy
Only fantasy
Honey-Honey~
イツデモyou're feelin' melancholy
Just call on me
I'll be there, you'll see
Honey-Honey~
アイシテル-Chapter Two"アイジョウ"
Is it too early?
Honey~Honey-Honey-
キミダケmake me feel this way
Even duse 'til dawn
Honey,アイシテル

Just one look into your eyes
I surrendered before I realized
The consequences
ヒトツシカ ミエナカッタ
All of the people standing around us ワカラナイ
Too late now トメラレナイ

Story ハツコイstory
The pain I've been enduring, cause
ソバニ イタイヨwith you endlessly~

Honey won't you ride with me?
All day, everyday, anyplace, anytime
イッショニ All through the night-

Only fantasy
Honey~Honey~
イツデモyou're feelin' melancholy
Just call on me
I'll be there, you'll see
Honey~Honey~

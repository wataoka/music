Night has fallen for you
for me, for two of us

I'm scared of tomorrow
I'm sure, I'm definately sure
I'm scared of tomorrow
cos I'll love you more than today

Happy! Happy!
I'm such a Happy girl
let me kiss you darling
I'm crazy for you

Everybody falls in love
so easily, too easily

no one expects the end
we're dreaming it will never end
It doesn't make sense to practice
How to smile in Tokyo without you

Happy! Happy!
I'm such a Happy girl
let me in your side
I'm crazy for you

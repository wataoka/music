Beneath this winding road
I gaze upon my home
Through life's winter storm
You shelter me from farm
You warm me through and through

Forever you will be
Exactly what I need
To make sense of it
To make the pieces fit
You helped me see it through
I need you

There's no place
I could ever find
That gives me such
Peace of mind
And makes me easy
Free and easy
There's no place
That l've ever been
That touches me within
Quite like you do
How I love you
Yes, I do.

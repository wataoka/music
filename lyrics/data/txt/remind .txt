"I was standing in the feelings
that was glowing."And he said
"Everything is wholly broken
in the firt place"And he laughed.

Like you talk to a man living
in a deep ocean. And like
you reveal the secret of a
distant star, far away.

I step forward to face
myself The night creeps up
on us from the dusk
where it was hiding.

I step forward to face
myself The night is throwing
the night now.

Remind me, the moonlight
is holding the night nice and calm.
When it's holding the night,
remind me.
Remind me, the world made
the night so we don't miss the glow.
It's a faint glow of life.
Remind me, remind me.

No one never, ever stops
looking for the truth in life,
Everyone is going through the
sad nights all by themselves.

We can't see the real treasure with our eyes.
But you know, that's why
we have music beside us like a dream floating on the floss silk.

Remind me, I was standing
in the feeling that was glowing.

We were once connected.
Remind me.
It's a faint glow if life.

I'm feeling myself, you're feeling yourself.
Feeling sharpened and, come into a light.
I'm feeling myself, you're feeling yourself.
Feeling sharpened and, come into a light.

Find the air,
Finding the earth,
Finding water,
Finding fire,
You find yourself standing
Remind me.
Remind me.
Remind me.
Remind me.

Remind me, the moonlight
is holding the night nice and calm.
When it's holding the night,
remind me.
Remind me, the world made
the night so we don't miss the glow.
It's a faint glow of life.
Remind me, remind me.

When you're one with the light,
remind me.

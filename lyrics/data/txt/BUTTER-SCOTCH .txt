Hot summer day
Come and whisper to me
Do I attract and drown, why is it so?

Too much
BUTTER-SCOTCH
Sick in bed I ate myself sick with…
BUTTER-SCOTCH,
let green eyed girl say want she will
I don't care for destiny
How wonderful this funny funny girl

He used me like a rabbit,
I'm in deep but smilin, continue
To till it's all gone
What taste is this?

BUTTER-SCOTCH!

It's a happy day alway put on a sad face
Give me your smile
For me, little bit more as expected

Too much
BUTTER-SCOTCH
Sick in bed I ate myself sick with…
BUTTER-SCOTCH,
let green eyed girl say want she will
I don't care for destiny
How wonderful this funny funny girl

He used me like a rabbit,
I'm in deep but smilin, continue
To till it's all gone
What taste is this?

This candy is sweet
He will never know I'm nervous
What do you want to do right now?

Stomp your foot!
BUTTER-SCOTCH,
let green eyed girl say want she will
I don't care for destiny
How wonderful this funny funny girl

He used me like a rabbit,
I'm in deep but smilin, continue
To till it's all gone
What taste is this?

BUTTER-SCOTCH!

And she's all I need
I see her everywhere
Don't mean to stare
Between the lines
Different faces

If you would notice me
At the right time
At the right place
I know you'd like
What I have to offer you

We should get away

(And) I would give anything, if anything would please you
And you wouldn't care about all of my imperfections

You could be waiting
In the same line at the same time
You could be dreaming
Similar things that I do
And you could be waiting
So long that it never comes
But I don't mind waiting
Maybe waiting is all I need

And she's all I need
I see her everywhere
Don't mean to stare
Between the lines
Different faces

If you would notice me
At the right time
At the right place
I know you'd like
What I have to give to you

We should get away

I would give anything, if anything would please you
And you wouldn't care about all of my imperfections

You could be waiting
In the same line at the same time
You could be dreaming
Similar things that I do
And you could be waiting
So long that it never comes
But I don't mind waiting
Maybe waiting is all I need

You could be waiting
In the same line at the same time
You could be dreaming
Similar things that I do
And you could be waiting
So long that it never comes
But I don't mind waiting
Maybe waiting is all I need

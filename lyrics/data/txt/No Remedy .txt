First you gotta know that うなだれた顔を持ち上げて
sit up straight 胸張って この道を行こう
second one is どうかこのまま体揺らして
riddim に身を任せて楽しんで 行こうぜ 朝が来る時間まで

Well I was born in okinawa the island's irie 父母から受けたこの身一つに
raised in tokyo and New York city 自然と身に付いたこの melody
I seh,導火線に火がつく瞬間は 16 暑い夏の午後曇天下
I drop the needle down on to the 7inches その場で広がる音楽の magic
so I got up and joined the band as you can see
it was a natural thing I grab the mic
燃える上がる情熱に no remedy all did was play music with my homies

Then you start to realize 決して楽な道じゃない
sit up straight 胸張って 誇りを持って
I seh woo woo woo 雨の日は雨のように
I seh fu fu fu 晴れの日は晴れやかに
I'll drive the motorcycle even if it rains or snows
I take the 環七 straight down to 下北 north
ガソリン燃やせ この内燃機関
you know it's better than the bus or subway or train

I'll be 出たとこ勝負 like “Yo,it's me”
well I'll be tossing the dice and screaming holy shit!
I don't know whether there's a juicy rambutan
but it's a better way to live than searching country signs

so I got up and started this band it was a natural thing
I grab on to this mic,here I stand
燃える上がる情熱に no remedy all I did was play music with my homies

さあみんな 揺らしな Groovin'on and on and on and on このままで…
さあみんな 揺らしな Moving on and on and on and on

well I was born in okinawa the irie, island's
taken away to the mainland when I was only one
raised in tokyo and New York city 体から湧き出る この melody
I seh,導火線に火がつく瞬間は 16 暑い夏の午後曇天下
riddim に身を任せ楽しんで 行こうぜ 朝が来る時間まで

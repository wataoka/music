How could you be so  How could you be そう
もうありえないよ (How to believe her)
自分勝手なその態度 尽きることのないウソ

girl you got me in love all in for the win and i
was locked to your love so true honey-boo not a thought
to upset ya - it rocks to've met ya
diamonds and pearls couldn't match-up my win
now you wanna be aware move a little more slow
never pickin' up my calls it's gettin' kinda wack, uh!
can't believe you throwin' shade baby that's wrong
afterall you put on you deserve this song

曖昧な関係 問いつめたって 答えの無いゲーム
Monday to Sunday 振り回され Hey Baby don't lie to me Oh!

Hey You're stupid liar You're stupid liar
バレバレな嘘などもういらない
You're stupid liar You're stupid liar  You know? I know!!
このままじゃ君を Baby I'm gonna hate you
近づきたくない Baby don't do this
You're stupid liar You're stupid liar liar liar liar

How could you be そう How could you be もう
何がウソ? 君の全てが怖くて ただ…黙るしかなく 隣で笑うんだ

let me tell ya...  surely it was you and me we'd see the sunset risin'
one day you would come up surprisin'
straight mean bein', how you gonna flip that from lovely to grimey
it'a shakin' my head... no doubt it's zone in the red...
step back relax look back never that our love just fade to black

Hey You're stupid liar You're stupid liar
ゾクゾクさせるほど Psychoなレディ
You're stupid liar You're stupid liar You know? I know!!
でも会うとナゼか Baby I can't hate you
深みにハマって You know I love you
You're stupid liar You're stupid liar liar liar liar

真実はどこへ? もう見えないよ
チープすぎる罠 抜け出せないよ

I'm so Stupid I'm so Stupid I'm so Stupid
I'm Stupid I'm so Stupid Stupid
I'm so Stupid I'm so Stupid I'm so Stupid (oh no～)

Hey You're stupid liar You're stupid liar
バレバレな嘘などもういらない
You're stupid liar You're stupid liar You know? I know!!
このままじゃ君を Baby I'm gonna hate you
近づきたくない Baby don't do this (Baby don't do this)
You're stupid liar You're stupid liar liar liar liar

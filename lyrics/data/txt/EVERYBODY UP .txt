Been waiting for my time to run out
Then Imma be out and get into something
Don't treat it like it's nothing
Cuz you only live once
Cuz you only live once
Keep staring at the clock on the wall
Keys in my pocket runnin' home fast
Don't treat it like it's nothing
Cuz you only live once
Cuz you only live once

I need everybody up it's about to go down
Been a long week so (I'm) tired of it now
I need everybody up it's about to go down
DJ play this song real loud
Cuz we like to party
I need to party
I need everybody up it's about to go down
(Cuz) we gonna party 'til the sun goes up

Every week it's the same old thing
Work work work
Just to make a living
Every day is the same old thing
Honestly I can't wait to leave
Then I get my swag on
Get my hair right
Call my guys it's about to be a good night
Party party party
Cuz you only live once
Cuz you only live once

I need everybody up it's about to go down
Been a long week so (I'm) tired of it now
I need everybody up it's about to go down
DJ play this song real loud
Cuz we like to party
I need to party
I need everybody up it's about to go down
(Cuz) we gonna party 'til the sun goes up

I can't wait no more
When I walk through that door
I can't wait no more
When I walk through that door

I need everybody up it's about to go down
Been a long week so (I'm) tired of it now
I need everybody up it's about to go down
DJ play this song real loud
Cuz we like to party
I need to party
I need everybody up it's about to go down
(Cuz) we gonna party 'til the sun goes up

I need everybody up it's about to go down
Been a long week so (I'm) tired of it now
I need everybody up it's about to go down
DJ play this song real loud
Cuz we like to party
I need to party
I need everybody up it's about to go down
(Cuz) we gonna party 'til the sun goes up

When you're down and troubled,
And you need some loving care,
And nothing, nothing is going right,
Close your eyes and think of me,
And soon I will be there,
To brighten up even your darkest night.

You just call out my name,
And you know wherever I am,
I'll come running to see you again.
Winter, spring, summer or fall,
All you have to do is to call.
And I'll be there.
You've got a friend.

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds,
And that old north wind begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

it is good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

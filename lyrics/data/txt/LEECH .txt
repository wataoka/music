Nobody believes you.

Marbleの壁は高く泥に塗れていたよ
殴りつけられたような痛みが俺を離さねぇ
大量に零れたImperfection 完全に飲まれたExpression
I who sings black again. I who dyes black again.
何度も頭を潰すInsult

Let's send a gallows in the last scene which you hope for.
Don't hush up a mistake.
Take responsibility.
未だ見えねぇ行方知れずの物 纏わせたのは全て上辺だけ
売り飛ばされたのは思想の偽造 凝りもせずまた寄って来やがる

Can you hear the counting song of pain?
The president.
[I want to scatter your face.]
目に映る答えを描く
[I want to scatter your trick]
Can you hear the counting song of pain?
The president.
[I want to scatter your excuse.]
黒き日は今も褪せぬまま…
A prosecute. Your luck will run out someday.
Hatred to you is a proper act.

流れた欠陷と無表情と無力 時が忘却に飢えても 忘れる事はしない

You are the same as a leech which sucks blood to live.

Let's send a gallows in the last scene which you hope for.
Don't hush up a mistake. Take responsibility.
未だ見えねぇ行方知れずの物 纏わせたのは全て上辺だけ
売り飛ばされたのは思想の偽造 凝りもせずまた寄って来やがる

Can you hear the counting song of pain?
The president.
[I want to scatter your face.]
目に映る答えが消える
[I want to scatter your trick]
Can you hear the counting song of pain?
The president.
[I want to scatter your excuse.]
黒き日を葬る無意味さに
I felt humiliation

美しき静寂が悲しげに揺れてる目を塞ぐ事さえ罪
A prosecute. Your luck will run out someday.
Can you hear the counting song of pain? The president.
You are the same as a leech which sucks blood to live.

Warning

Shout a warning

We see warnings everyday and everywhere
What are they warning?

Shout a warning

Real danger is approaching
Something invisible is creeping
Something fatal is leaking
Something irresistable is penetrating
but where?

...in our minds, in our soul, in our flesh, in our bones...
...in your mind, in your soul, in your flesh and in your bones...

The globe is warning
Your parents are warning
Do you know?

The Bible is warning
Pray for mercy
The Bible is warning
What are they warning?

C'est a la sueur de ton visage que tu mangeras du pain,
Jusqu'a ce que tu retournes dans la terre,
d'ou tu as ete pris, car tu es poussiere, et tu retourneras
dans la poussiere

We've gonna shout a warning

DUSTZ is warning!
Now is the time for rising!
Shout a warning!
So, Do you wanna hear?

DUSTZ is warning!
Now is the time for rising!
Fire the warning gun!
So, Do you wanna hear?

I wanna break down like a diesel truck
I wanna kick start cause my love is stuck
I wanna get hot so hot I wanna scream

Get down down down down down down down tonight

I got a fever…
Tonight…
Yeah…

We should be alone
I wanna take you closer to pleasure baby
We should be alone
I wanna take you my darling and shiver your heart

I got a fever…
Your heart…

We should go down to the beach arcade
I wanna take a picture cause we're gonna fade
Can't promise you forever, but we got today

Get down down down down down down down tonight

I got a fever…

We should be alone
I wanna take you closer to pleasure baby
We should be alone
I wanna take you my darling and shiver your heart

I got a fever…
Your heart…

I gotta tingling and feel it in my bones
This is communication baby when you moan
I'm like a tattoo on your body cause you're mine
I wanna watch you shiver, shiver come alive!

We should be alone
I wanna take you closer to pleasure baby
We should be alone
I wanna take you my darling and shiver your heart

Your heart…

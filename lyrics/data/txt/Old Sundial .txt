That cloud is dark gray.
Who made when?
Blow off early!
Or, I'd die.

That bird is noisy.
He's gossipy.
Fly and pass early!
Or, I'd die.

Am I a shadow?
Where is substance?

So I'm doubted.

Or, I'd die.

Am I a shadow?
Where is substance?
I think that
I lost sight of oneself.
Please take it back!
Please take it back now!

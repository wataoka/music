Where is my life?
What is my name?

Fear It is my side
Dead It is nothing

Where is my dream?
Can I see you?

Here This is silent
Red This is blood

Fade away Under the sky
Falling love in the moon light
Sail away to the sunrise
Kiss me under the stardust
Ride on the endless light
In this moment
Spark

I wanna fly high
I wanna find out
Just take my timeless heart
I wanna feel you
Reaching the space

far away
far away
far away
beyond the world
far away

I'm looking for the new...

Where is your hand
Why am I crying

Truth It is future
End It is nothing

In the darkness garage
Looking for you

Sky This is airborn
Sea This is nightmare
Alive

Call my name when you are going to burst
Life is future
Rise up your mind

I wanna still live
I wanna still sing
Fly me to your inner light
I wanna touch you

Bring me the light

far away
far away
far away
beyond the world
far away
I'm looking for the new sky

Fade away Under the sky
Falling love in the moon light
Sail away to the sunrise
Kiss me under the stardust
Ride on the endless light
In this moment
Spark

I wanna fly high
I wanna find out
Just take my timeless heart
I wanna feel you
Reaching the space

far away
far away
far away
beyond the world
far away
I'm looking for the new sky

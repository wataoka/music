I can't believe the time has flown away so fast 
It's hard for me to say good-bye to you 
You're gonna graduate, we're gonna leave the school today
Remember when we used to laugh 
Skipping the class together 
Those were the happy days 
I won't forget So many freiends around 
Having a lot of fun out in the sun
One summer night, you took me to a football game 
Under the moon you held my hand
And you said we'd never part Good-bye,University 
I don't know what to do from now
‘Cause I won't see you anymore Good-bye,
University Look at the sky it's started to rain
[started to rain] 
I can't believe the day has come to us at last 
It's sad to think that we were just too young 
I'm gonna graduate,we're gonna leave the school today 
Remember when we used to talk 
Drinking some coffee together 
Those were the happy days 
I won't forget 
So many friends around Having a lot of fun out in the sun 
In winter time, you took me to the friday dance
Under the light, we danced all night 
It was long long time ago Good-bye,University
I don't know what to do from now 
‘Cause I won't see you anymore
Good-bye,University 
Look at the sky it's started to rain 
Good-bye,University
I don't know what to do from now 
‘Cause I won't see you anymore
Good-bye,University 
Look at the sky it's started to rain
Good-bye,University
I don't know what to do from now‘
Cause I won't see you anymore…

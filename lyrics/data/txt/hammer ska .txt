Be brave Be brave この時の果て 今日が昔話になるまで

The courage to knowingly step forward that and the pain and sadness with it.
There are as many minds as people. So respect is born, and then conflict is born.
The boring world, the even more boring me from the time we're born it's not fair.
I don't want to get hurt so I don't believe anyone. Don't be stupid!

Hammer! Bring a hammer! Hammer! Bring one!
Smash it up! Bring one! Hammer! You are dismissed!

What do you mean "from the start"!? Hey! What do you mean "start over"!?
Excuse me? Shouldn't I come back!? Hey! What is "from tomorrow"!?
I have to start all over? What do you mean do it all over?
What? I don't need to come anymore? Hey! What is "from tomorrow"!?

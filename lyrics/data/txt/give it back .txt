I don't know what I should be
I don't know what you can do

so many days so many things are driving me crazy

you always tell me I'm gonna take on the world
that I'm gonna make things better than the way they are

but here's the point, you'll never try to deal with my pain

sometimes you just don't know the truth
you think I'm left here all alone
caught up in chains that I tied for you
baby think twice
and go down on your knees and cry for more

I don't know what I should do
I don't know where I can go now
so many faces and so many voices are dribing me crazy

you try to keep me only in your world
but I can't take it, cannot take it no, no more

well waht have you done to my
innocent heart and soul

sometimes you just don't know the truth
I've done what I could for you
you treat my heart
like you'd roll a dice
I'm sick of it
just go down on your knees and cry for more

you always tell me I'm gonna take on the world
that I'm gonna make things better than the way they are

but here's the point, you'll never try to deal with my pain

sometimes you just don't know the truth
you think I'm left here all alone
caught up in chains that I tied for you
baby think twice and go down on your knees 'cause

sometimes you just don't know the truth
I've done waht I could do for you
you treat my heart
like you'd roll a dice
I'm sick of it
just get down on your knees and cry for more

Follow Me
Baby, I Won't Let You Leave If You Believe In Me
And I Always Set You Free From All Those Yesteryears
But You Don't Know How Much
I Got Believe In You

I Was Staring At Your Shoulder Shivering
In Such A Coldest Summer Breeze
Meanwhile I Wonder Why We're Here
Look For The Line Between Love And Friends
We'll Be Twisting Ourselves Again

I Was Standing At The Corner On The Street
Watching The Wheels Are Turning Free
Waiting to Back Up On My Feet
Reading A Line Between Night And Day
I'll Be Twisting Myself Again

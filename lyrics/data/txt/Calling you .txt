Love you 夜明けまで I miss you, baby
まだ生まれない不安にただ dancing alone
好きさ瞳の奥淡い色の virgin blue
君と踊り明かす夢に舞う butterfly
Hello..
君と velvet sky

Heart beat 鳴り止まぬ silky night
触れて思い知る全てが sweet on you
胸の slight fever 思いのほか bitter taste
妖艶に染まりゆく闇に宿る secret rose
Hello..
君と naked moon

Just because the night is tender
Feeling you more close in my dreams
Can you hear my love is calling?

I just wanna call you, baby
Don't wanna hide my love
I just wanna touch you, baby
Don't wanna leave my love

What makes the world go round?

Light me hide me 気まぐれな feeling
今生まれゆく予感はそう forbidden fruits
揺れる town light 待ち侘びる lonely night
君に酔いしれるこの胸に colored pain
Hello..
君と purple rain

Just because the night is tender
Feeling you more close in my dreams
Can you hear my love is calling?

I just wanna call you, baby
Don't wanna hide my love
I just wanna touch you, baby
Don't wanna leave my love

What makes the world go round?

Oh, I wanna kiss you, baby
Don't wanna lose my love
And I wanna call you, baby
Don't wanna hide my love

What makes the world go round?
Love makes the world go round

Close to you
君に描いた days
揺れて love
Give it more
Give it more
My love is calling

Can you hear my love is calling?

I just wanna call you, baby
Don't wanna hide my love
I just wanna touch you, baby
Don't wanna leave my love

What makes the world go round?

Oh, I wanna kiss you, baby
Don't wanna lose my love
And I'm gonna call you, baby
Don't wanna hide my love

What makes the world go round?
Love makes the world go round

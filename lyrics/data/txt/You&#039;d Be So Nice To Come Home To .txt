You'd be so nice to come home to.
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high
Sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise
To come home to and love.

You'd be so nice to come home to.
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high
Sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise
To come home to and love.

“Can I have Double-Double please?”
This is what we have every morning
Old people, young people, even elementary school kids!
Yes I am from Belleville, Ontario, Canada

Make-up on my face will turn me on
I'm coming to your place!
Smell of coffee brings our heart warmer

Eh eh Cowboy! Do you wanna go to Tim Hourtons?
Would you like to talk about love?
Kissing on your cheek whenever I want to
Yah, this is the privilege of a small town
Make a mess and leave it just like that!
I don't care what papa and mama say!
They are talking to me but everything I hear is
“Blah blah blah blah blah!”

Wake-up slowly no one cares who's on time.
Cranking cars and beers are in the back of his truck!

Well, after all I love this place
All we have is mall, bowling and bars
Twinkle little stars on clearest sky
What we love forever and ever...
Forever and ever...

Do you wanna sit for a sec?
Here is a chair made out of Haybale
Just a little uncomfortable
Hey baby you gotta hole in your sock
Hey babe please don't stop your humming
“Hmmm...♪”

Eh eh Cowboy! Do you wanna go to Tim Hourtons?

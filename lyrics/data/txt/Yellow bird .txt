one rainy afternoon
a yellow bird nests in grandpa's tree
I have stories to tell you tonight

I'm sitting by the window pane
thinking of you in the lazy sky
I have stories to tell you tonight

do you remember the summer day
trees were swaying with new lives
I have stories to tell you tonight

time flies like an arrow
I suddenly feel left alone
I have stories to tell you tonight

wrapped in warm spring sunshine
the yellow bird laid new life
I have stories to tell you tonight

time flies in a maybe sky
exiting chatter of baby birds
I have stories to tell you tonight

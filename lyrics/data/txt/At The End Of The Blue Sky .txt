Originally chaos was out there
Then light and darkness showed up
She split in lands seas
Flowers and trees appeared

Finally I was out here
with calm and silence in chaos
Across the land and sea
As a bird flying free

Please call me hold me remember me
Don't cry don't fear never forget
Call me hold me remember me
Please smile

Finally I was out here
with calm and silence in chaos
Across the land and sea
As a bird flying free

I dip my hands into this darkness
This is the ink of all our lifetimes
Here in this world of utter silence
Let the stones speak to me

Tattooed here across my skin "I WILL LIVE"
Like a rose that grows from the wreckage
Blood red beautitul-
As the storms all around me are now breathless

Is this the end of the Raging Road
Through the tangled mind?
Is this the end of starlit skies?
Are we walking blind?

Let me set out through this morning
Open arms to greet the empty ages
Reborn, see how I'm circling
I'm a sailor-eternal

Is this the end of the Wasted Way?
Is this the death of time?
Is this the end of blue psychic seas?
Are we sailing blind?

O look down on me
Watch over me as I walk across this world
O hold me in hidden hands
Let us go

O look down on me
Watch over me as I walk across this world
Teach me how to take my first footsteps
...to the end

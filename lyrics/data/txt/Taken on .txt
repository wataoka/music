I'm in a hurryさ いつも
Too tightな24
Just like a rabbitさ
Don't you know?
飛び跳ねながら run run run

The clock is always poker face
My face is changing to the bitter smile
急いでもNo change the world
ダメダメでもいいんじゃない?

I'm in a hurryさ いつも
Too tightな24
Just like a rabbitさ
Don't you know?
飛び跳ねながら run run run

I'm in a hurryさ 一応
Routineな日常
残念が口グセ
Don't you know?
ねぇ ちゃんとしようよ

Taken on, taken on, taken on the funky music brand new
Taken on, taken on, taken on the funky music around you
Taken on, taken on, taken on the funky music brand new
Taken on, taken on, taken on the funky music around you

The clock is always poker face
My face is changing to the bitter smile
急いでもNo change the world
ダメダメでもいいんじゃない?

Our hearts are joined together
We have such a deep connection
That's how we fare the stormy weather
That hits us now every single day

Travel the speed of light
Over the furious ocean
And I will face the rainy weather
To get my message across to you

Hold on - a dictionary of phrases to tell you how I'm feeling
I'll make the perfect choices to be clear
I always want to have you here
Avoiding a break down

All of the magic that I wanna show you
So just be open to all that is possible
This is my phrase speaker, it's calling to you across the distance
There is so much that I wanna tell you
Communication - I'm doing it all for you
Miracles really happen - you have to believe
Delivered to you, delivered to you, my message to you

Our heads are locked together,
To resolve a recurring problem
That time and space cannot endeavor
To ever really tackle right

There are so many gadgets
And means to keep in contact
I can't believe you're not in favor
Of great big steps in technology

After all - there are so many phrases to tell you how I'm feeling
So many perfect methods of describing
How the color of the sky is changing
Far beyond imagination

All of the wonder that I wanna show you
So just be open up to all that is possible
This is your flight motor - oh, please don't resist it
Let's bridge the distance
There is so much that I wanna tell you
Telepathy's  not always the quickest way
We gotta make it happen - exchanging the keys
Delivered to you, delivered to you, my message to you

Sometimes the rain
Pours down around me
I'm feeling so very blue
I want to run away - ah
Sometimes my heart
It starts to shut down
All my thoughts start to turn to you
They're bringing a shiny new day - yeah

Night is falling, there's no need to fear it
The rain is pouring, there's no need to run from it
This is my platform and I'm always beside you across the distance
There is so much that I wanna show you
Communication - I'm doing it all for you
I know the sun will shine soon

And everything that's precious
And everything I treasure I hold it
Right here in my hand, I'll keep it special
Got to be aware of every option

There is so much that I wanna tell you
Communication I'm doing it all for you
Miracles really happen - you have to believe
Delivered to you, delivered to you, my message to you

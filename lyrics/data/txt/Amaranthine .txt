Your hand in mine was warm
Despite the coming storm
That my horoscope warned me of that day
Your words were oh-so-cold
And such fortunes weren't foretold
That September when you turned me away

All the stars that night
Were blurry through
The tears I wouldn't let you see me cry
I walked away
The moonlight painting you in silver-grey...

My love for you won't change
Burn out or fade away
No fortunes ever told
Can scare me from your side
What kind of fate is this that could
Be cruel enough to keep me from you?
Alone as I star-gaze
All dream of sleep evades
I think of you and sigh
This sepia October
With the summer constellations
Fading away

Cold autumn creeps on in
And the starry skies spin
As Scorpio rises high above
His stinger poised to dart
Straight through your frozen heart
And maybe somehow make you love me

When you left me here
My faith in love began
To fade away my dear
But in your eyes
I found the strength
I needed to say...

My love for you won't change
Burn out or fade away
No fortunes ever told
Can scare me from your side
What kind of fate is this that could
Be cruel enough to keep me from you?
Alone as I star-gaze
All dream of sleep evades
I think of you and sigh
This black and white November
The coloured autumn leaves
Blowing away

My love for you won't change
Burn out or fade away
No fortunes ever told
Can scare me from your side
What kind of fate is this that could
Be cruel enough keep me from you?
The moonlight steals my gaze
All dream of sleep evades
I think of you and sigh
The wind hints of December
As this frigid autumn night
Fades into day

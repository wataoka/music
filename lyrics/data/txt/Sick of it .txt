Do you wanna come to me
I don't wanna talk to you
Everytime I see your face
you make me feeling bad
Do you want me to be same
I can't take it any more
Let me get this straight to you
I'm sick of it

Tell me what do you know
about me and my charactor
How could you know my name
I can remember nothing
Why is this happening
while I was in a dream last night
I was drunk there I go again

I know it's my bad habit
I can not control my self indeed
Give up drinking is so hard for me
Sorry choose another day

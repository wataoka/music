Remember you came in unknown
Taking the phone, alone from the outer zone
Only I saw weakness all long

Oh baby you were small and slow
Feeling the blow of wind from the entrance hall
Not goin' with the flow, did you know?

Seeing you, I realized
Nothingness you had, captivated me
So follow me, I can take you all around

※※Hey follow me now, you can follow beside now
　　I'll keep you safe from a far so believe me
　　Hey follow me now, follow beside me, you know?
　　I wanna be your shelter forever
　　When you're around, something you have makes me strong
　　So come follow me now, I can be your shelter forever

拾ってきたsomewhere　誰かの落とした物
忘れられた場所

くすぐられたよ　my僅かな母性本能
so　嘘なはずないんだ

ゆずれない　願いがひとつ
喧嘩上等　守るよ
星屑の海　誓い立て　永遠に輝く
弱い君の側　いるだけで力が湧き出るんだ
Follow me now,　守れるよ

ゆずれない　願いがひとつ
喧嘩上等　守るよ
星屑の海　誓い立て　永遠に輝く

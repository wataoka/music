When I wander
Is when I wonder
Why your secrets
Stay in the dark
You're a stranger
Could be danger
If I cave
(And) I give you my heart

Undercover
Under pressure
Sending signs I
Can't figure out

Whatcha hiding
Whatcha holding
In the dark of yours it
Makes me wanna figure out just

Why... why... why... why... why
Underneath a twilight sky
Why... why... why... why
I am standing here so shy
Why... why... why... why
Got me feeling like a spy
No hello or goodbye
And then it keeps me wondering why

All the mind tricks
Make my mind sick
I was cool now
I'm watching my back

What's your secret?
I'd believe it
Gimme something more or
I'm just gonna keep on askin'

Why... why... why... why... why
Underneath a twilight sky
Why... why... why... why
I am standing here so shy
Why... why... why... why
Got me feeling like a spy
No hello or goodbye
And then it keeps me wondering why

When I look, so many eyes
When I look, so many lives
When I speak, no one replies
When I speak, cut down to size
When I walk, so far behind
When I walk, you blow my mind
And when we meet tonight
Gonna make you tell me

When I wander
Is when I wonder
Why your secrets
Stay in the dark

Why... why... why... why... why
Underneath a twilight sky
Why... why... why... why
I am standing here so shy
Why... why... why... why
Got me feeling like a spy
No hello or goodbye
And then it keeps me wondering why

Why... why... why... why
Why... why... why... why
Why... why... why... why

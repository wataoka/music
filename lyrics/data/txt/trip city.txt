brain dead and a lot of junk
wiggin' out like a cyber punk
goin' round, round, round
get me out of this city

brain fry in a virus pan
got too high super cyber man
get me down, down, down
get me out of trip city

take me, take me to the lab
take me, take me to the lab
take me, take me to the lab

brain drain and I need a fix
flippin' out, couldn't get no kicks
comin' down, down, down
and I'm feelin' real shitty
goin' round, round, round
get me out of this city
comin' down, down, down
yeah, I'm feelin real shitty
jumpin' round, round, round
get me out of trip city
comin' down, down, down
and it's really not pretty

trip city
trip city
trip city

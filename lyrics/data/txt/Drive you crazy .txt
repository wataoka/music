My body responds just to pain
Your words
Your whip
Your scars I like
I feel・・・just like・・・
I got a beautiful song
Yes, I go・・・I take you・・・
beyond the wild world

I turn off my switch
to play a hole girl
"Peach Pie
rag doll
ice cream I like"I say my lines
You feel・・・just like・・・
You got a beautiful car
Yes, I go・・・I take you・・・
beyond the wild world

Running up a slope, steep slope
and we'll fall down
Running up a slope, last slope
and we'll fall down

Beautiful・・・How beautiful・・・
Beautiful car taking you

CRASH・BOOM・BANG!!!

遠い夜の 記憶が また 私を呼んで
広いシーツの海に 漂う 君はもういないのに

SOMETHING I THOUGHT WE HAD BETWEEN US WAS SO REAL
BUT ALL YOU DID WAS CHOOSE ME TO WOO ME, SCREW ME TO RULE ME, CONFUSE
ME, REFUSE ME, ABUSE ME, YOU RUIN ME,
SOMETHING I THOUGHT WE'VE SHARED ALL THESE YEARS WAS SO RARE
BUT IT WAS JUST A....A DREAM.................... 

紫に 街が染まり 思い出だす 君のなごり
忘れてたはずの痛み あたしの今を奪う

SOMETHING I THOUGHT WE HAD BETWEEN US WAS SO REAL
BUT ALL YOU DID WAS CHOOSE ME TO WOO ME, SCREW ME TO RULE ME, CONFUSE
ME, REFUSE ME, ABUSE ME, YOU RUIN ME,
SOMETHING I THOUGHT WE'VE SHARED ALL THESE YEARS WAS SO RARE
BUT IT WAS JUST A....A DREAM.................... 

遠い夜の 記憶が また 私を呼んだ
醒めたシーツの海に 漂うあたしを 嘲笑うように

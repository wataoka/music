Morning sun lights us
Every time that you smile
Morning sun watches us
Sometimes I smile at you

The sun rises slowly
In the cold morning of winter
I tell you my dream
You smile gently

Only time, only time, only time, only time

単純な繰り返しが
本当はただ大切で
気付いていないだけなんです

Only time, only time, only time, only time

An old woman waters the flower
I play the guitar and sing

Only time, only time, only time, only time

Find
The guiding light
My memory so grey
I'm trying not to fall away
The guiding light
Begins to shine on at night
Shining on my sea
I know this lighthouse will cast a light deep

Fall
Below the ground
Drop in the frozen sea
Let go of all my fear, yeah

Found
In guiding light it showed
What do I want
I'm trying not to fall away

Fall
Below the ground
Drop in the frozen sea
Let go of all my fear and see me know me and now
Fall
Below my mind
Drop in the frozen sea
Let go of all my fear and see me know me and now

Tell me please
Tell me why
Tell me how
Tell me now

Tell me how to / when to / what to / tell me

Fall

The guiding light
My memory so grey
What do I want
I'm trying not to fall away

All is mine

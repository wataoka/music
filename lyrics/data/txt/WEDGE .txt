Loneliness is weeping hiding in your heart
A little piece of stones on the wild road are crying

Like the iron wedge tied me up
Both the Past and the Present living
in my mind no let me go drifting in the time flow?

I believe we do anything
The moon glow can paint it
I am singing now just because of it

Move on to the better place
Many things are bitter state

Make it, do it again
Go on, move on, ride out
Stay wishing until it comes true

The day is clean from storm
You drive me crazy, but that's okay
Always we do the same way

The earth is round!
Walk and get the place we were
Tomorrow will come
It is so good time goes round!

Make it, do it again
Go on, move on, ride out
Stay wishing until it comes true

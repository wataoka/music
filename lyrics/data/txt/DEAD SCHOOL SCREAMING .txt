目覚めの悪い いつもの朝 犬のように 御利口で
転がるように 繰り返す日々
ALL STAR 履いて go to the「DEAD SCHOOL」

I'm just feeling nausea so bad

足掻けるはず アガイタハズ
噛み付く事 忘れたかい?
首輪は無い ノートを燃やせ
NAILを塗って fuck to the「DEAD SCHOOL」

I'm just feeling nausea
I'm just feeling languid
but, I don't care

Nothing is here already, I broke all system.
People call me parasitic
Only piles of shit, I've broken all the Rules
People call me parasitic

No passing by, hey hey hey hey
Monkey show is about to start
You definitely must see it.

Hey, you pressidents, can you restore my life back?
I don't think so

I'm just feeling nausea
I'm just feeling languid
but, I don't care

Nothing is here already, I broke all system.
People call me parasitic
Only piles of shit, I've broken all the Rules
People call me parasitic

Dead school play, round and round

You don't know how much I hate 
All the things you do 
T-R-O-U-B-L-E 
That is what you are made of 

Hell is where you belong 
Heaven can not wait for you 

So close your eyes & make a wish 
Today's the day that I am fighting you  
It's my turn to be 
A champion 

So shut your lies & count to three 
I'll take you down & you'll be smithereens 
It's my chance to be 
A champion 

Even if I lose my power 
I'll get right back up 
'Cause that's the power of love 
Something you don't have 

Heaven can not wait for you 

So close your eyes & make a wish 
Today's the day that I am fighting you  
It's my turn to be 
A champion 

So shut your lies & count to three 
I'll take you down & you'll be smithereens 
It's my chance to be 
A champion

You're so stupid, stupid, stupid

You're so stupid, stupid, stupid 

So close your eyes & make a wish 
Today's the day that I am fighting you  
It's my turn to be 
A champion 

So shut your lies & count to three 
I'll take you down & you'll be smithereens 
It's my chance to be 
A champion

You're so stupid, stupid, stupid

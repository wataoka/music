WE WERE WALKING DOWN THE STREET
6 AM YEAH WE WERE TALKING.
SMELL OF RAIN AND EARLY MORNING
IS ALL WE NEEDED TO GET STARTED
BUT SOMETHING HIT ME
I THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS FALLING DOWN
AND THEN I REALIZED
THAT I SAW SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE
EVERYDAY IS ALWAYS THE SAME
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I HADN'T FELT BEFORE
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE?
IT'S NOT LIKE RUNNING IS AN OPTION.
AND SHE WAS CRUMBLING DOWN, AND WE WERE FALLING DOWN,
AND WE COULD SEE IT ALL BECOME CLEARER.
SHE WAS CRUMBLING DOWN, AND WE WERE FALLING DOWN,
AND WE COULD SEE IT ALL BECOME CLEARER.

IT'S A LONG SHOT PENNY EVERYTHING YOU TELL ME,
YOU TURN IT INTO A LIE I REALLY WONDER IF
THE SUN THIS MORNING HAD NEVER RISEN?
THERE WOULD BE NO GOODBYES.

ITS FUNNY, WHAT I WANTED MOST,
I TURNED AWAY WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.
AND WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT WOULD COME TO THIS?
BUT NOW, IM ASKING FOR ANOTHER CHANCE.
AND NOW IM FALLING DOWN, MY WORLD IS CRUMBLING DOWN,
I WISH THAT IT WOULD ALL BECOME CLEARER.
AND NOW IM FALLING DOWN, MY WORLD IS CRUMBLING DOWN,
I WISH THAT IT WOULD ALL BECOME CLEARER.

IT'S A LONG SHOT PENNY EVERYTHING YOU TELL ME
I TURN IT INTO A LIE I REALLY WONDER IF THE SUN
THIS MORNING HAD NEVER RISEN?
THERE WOULD BE NO GOODBYES
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT ALONE,
CAUSE I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE,
AND IF I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD WANT YOU TO KNOW,
YOU WOULD COME BACK TO MY SIDE TO MY SIDE.

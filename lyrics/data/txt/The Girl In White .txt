The way she moves
Her sexy style
I watch her sending out signals of love
Without even smiling
You know she's got me so excited
Tell me who's The Girl In White

You know she acts so cool
And I feel so shy
But I could never face myself tomorrow
If I didn't try her
And now my worLd is loolin' brighter
I'm dancin' with The Girl In White

She makes me think about snow in the wintertime
She makes me think about the summer sunlight
I start to dream about spending all my time
With The Girl In White

Her eyes meet mine
Then they trun away
Does she know she's got a hold on me
With the game that she's playin'
I got to pull myself together
I'm fallin' for The Girl In White
I got to myself together
I'm fallin' for The Girl In White

The Girl In White, she does it right
The Girl In White, she's such a delight
The Girl In White whets my appetite
The Girl In White, she lights up the night

I got to pull myself together
I'm fallin' for The Girl In White
I got to myself together
I'm fallin' for The Girl In White

She's doin' it right
She's doin' it&lt; oh so right

Take me back and I'll never let go
Take me back and I'll never look back
Cause you're keeping me strong
Cause you're keeping me alive
You're the reason why, I can't walk away again

Take me back and I'll never leave you
Take me back and I'll never hurt you
I am always by your side
I will be here till the end
Just wait for me, never let you down again

Tick tick tock, and turn back the clock
The Times running out and slipping away
They can't stop me now, I'm moving along
And all I see is the light up ahead

Ring ring ring and hear the bell ring
Now no turning back and no crying no more
I cross my heart I promise you now
You are not alone believe what I say

Now I see you standing looking out for me
The reflection you look at me in your heart, in my heart forever

Take me back and I'll never let go
Take me back and I'll never look back
Cause you're keeping me strong
Cause you're keeping me alive
You're the reason why, I can't let you go again

Take me back and I'll never leave you
Take me back and I'll never hurt you
I am always by your side
I will be here till the end
Just wait for me, never let you down again

Zig zig zag, I'm losing my way
Lost in emotion, hearts pounding away
Tell me why, I'm falling apart
I need you here, need you right by my side

Click click click, I found my way out
So clear and so bright, It's just waiting for me
Believe what is right, believe in yourself
I'll guide you out just follow me out

Now I see you standing reaching out to me
Everyday is so special to, only you, just for you forever

Take me back and I'll never let go
Take me back and I'll never look back
Cause you're keeping me strong
Cause you're keeping me alive
You're the reason why, I can't let you go again

Take me back and I'll never leave you
Take me back and I'll never hurt you
I am always by your side
I will be here till the end
Just wait for me, never let you down again, take me back again

Now I see you standing looking out for me
The reflection you look at me in your heart, in my heart forever

Take me back and I'll never let go
Take me back and I'll never look back
Cause you're keeping me strong
Cause you're keeping me alive
You're the reason why, I can't let you go again

Take me back and I'll never leave you
Take me back and I'll never hurt you
I am always by your side
I will be here till the end
Just wait for me, never let you down again, take me back again

Take me back and I'll never leave you
Take me back and I'll never hurt you

All I got to do is think of you
That keeps me from feelin' blue
Now that I met you
I will never be the same
When I'm close to you
I feel so alive

I'm helplessly yours...

All I wanna say is"I love you"
I never thought that I could feel this way
Now that I found you
I will never let you go
When I'm close to you
I feel so alive

I'm helplessly yours
I'm helplessly yours...

I used to feel so lost
Sad and lonely too
'cause I never had someone like you
I don't worry anymore
Now you're by my side
Ever since the day we met

All I got to do is think of you
That keeps me from feelin' blue
Now that I met you
I will be never be the same
When I'm close to you
I feel so alive

I'm helplessly yours
I'm helplessly yours...
Yours...

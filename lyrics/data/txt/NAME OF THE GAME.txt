Sure as heaven up above
You know love's
The name of the game
The name of the game
What the world needs plenty of
You know love's
The name of the game
The name of the game

Love can make a strong man weak
A blind man see
Love can set a prisoner free
Love can make a man stand tall
Or nations fall
Love is the tug pulls the rug
Right from under your feet

Love can lift you high
Love can bring you low
Love can make you cry
Cry right out for more
'Cause love's an itch
That you can't scratch
No no ne no

That's the way of love
People say that love's
The name of the game
Fits Just like a glove
I believe that love's
The name of the game

Sure as heaven up above
You know love's
The name of the game
The name of the game
What the world needs plenty of
You know love's
The name of the game
The name of the game

You can swear you'll never play
Such foolish games
That your heart is made of clay
But just hear that old love call
And after all

You'll feel the flame burn again
That's the name of the game

Love can make you blue
Love can make you burn
Treat you like a fool
Still you never learn
And you can bet
It ain't over yet
No no no no

That's the way of love
People say that love's
The name of the game
Fits just like a glove
I believe that love's
The name of the game

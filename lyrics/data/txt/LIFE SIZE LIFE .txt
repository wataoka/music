I don't want to sing That kindly song.
I neither am such man nor long for him.
But everyone still likes him twopenny song.
「Exert yourself! Don't exert yourself!」
Do you aim at a slave?
I'd like to be life-size.

You don't like telling a true thing.
「I'm that person」It's desired.
Your ear faces to only the pleasant voice.
Today and tomorrow are your real one.
I don't agree with you.
Because I'd like to be life-size.

she's a modern Venus.
Be my girl!
She laughed at my unkind song.

I don't want to sing That kindly song.
I neither am such man nor long for him.
So I say again.
I'd like to be life-size.

I'll get over lone night
I'd like to be life-size.

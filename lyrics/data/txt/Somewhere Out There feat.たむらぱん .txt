Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Some ones thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someones saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

And even though i know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And then the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be togethor
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams
Come true

And even though i know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And then the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be togethor
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams
Come true

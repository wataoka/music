I'm being swallowed by the sound
Coming out of her doombox speakers
Want to resist but I don't know how
I feel my will getting weaker

I feel like singing Ah-ah-ah
The noise is ringing Ah-ah-ah

I'm reaching out to touch the waves
As they rush out of her doombox speakers
She is the master and I'm the slave
My only role is to please her

I feel like singing Ah-ah-ah
The buzz is ringing Ah-ah-ah

闇からの音が
骨の中まで揺さぶる
阿弥陀を迎える様な
無我夢中 あふれる

I feel like singing Ah-ah-ah
The noises ringing Ah-ah-ah
I feel like singing Ah-ah-ah
The buzz is ringing

Do you like this anyway?

Dice was thrown, now. No one can stop that.
Faster and faster.
We don't change even if six or one comes out.
Furiously and furiously.

Tell me the truth, tell me the existing meaning.
Call my name, raise a loud voice now.

賽は振られ 独楽は廻り続けて
消費られた 全てへ
灰に成れば 還る場所はあるけど
それまでは…眠れない

Erase an uncertain element if you feel uneasy.
Faster and faster.
Time doesn't wait you, Make up your mind by yourself.
Furiously and furiously.

Tell me the truth, tell me the existing meaning.
Call my name, raise a loud voice now.

欺き欺かれて 未曾有のパーティーへと

賽は振られ 独楽は廻り続けて
賭けたのは 自ら
白か黒か 決めるのは未だ早い
さあワルツを 踊ろう
Only a fool is pleased with such a thing.
Play the fool with me till the end.

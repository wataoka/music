Suddenly, the dawn of new day
When I pushed the door to come outside
The fresh cold air penetrates me
And I breathe out all my yesterday

Happiness is a transient thing
But it sparks like a flash light
I think I live with this moment
'Cause I feel so good thinking of your face

I try to run as fast I can
But'm getting further away
From the place I can get satisfied
I wonder if I ever get there

I'm the worst enemy to myself
I'm afraid I'm never be good enough
But I feel so different this moment
'Cause I can be a little kind to myself

Today is the day something waking up inside of me one by one
It took me by surprise that I know now I'm not alone any more

I come eunning to you to say good morning
'Cause I found you inside of my heart
I think I got courage to be honest
I wanna be with you
You're the only one for me

Standing on the rooftop of the building
The morning fog is all around
The golden light is gently coming down over the big city

I'll never forget this
I swear to this morning
'Cause I found you inside of my heart
I don't need another reason to live
Now I know for sure
You're the only one for me
You're the only one for me

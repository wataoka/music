I got a feeling inside of me
It's kind of strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, I don't know why
I guess these things have got to be

I got a new rose, I got her good
Guess I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town

See the sun, see the sun it shines
Don't get too close or it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
You can come back another day

I got a new rose, I got her good
Guess I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town

I never thought this could happen to me
This is strange why should it be
I don't deserve somebody this great
I'd better go or it'll be too late

I got a feeling inside of me
It's kind of strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, I don't know why
I guess these things have got to be

I got a new rose, I got her good
Guess I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town

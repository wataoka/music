Look over there
That one big hole
Somebody's got to move this huge stone
A dog? A hound?
I hear the sound
It is a half mile away from home

What was everything you were fighting for?
The sun in the sky it makes me so blue
Rotten everything that I liked you for
You can't give up!

Now you see
Chasing the light
It's blowing right through the air
We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
Come on! We'll get on all fours
And then we will crawl in the grass
Until lost in my mind
I am just losing myself

I try to care
They look so young
And left there toys and picked up a gun
They kiss goodbye a lullaby
I have to train them
All in bloody war

What was everything you were fighting for?
The sun in the sky it makes me so blue
Rotten everything that I liked you for
You can't give up!

Now you see
Chasing the light
It's blowing right through the air
We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
Come on! We'll get on all fours
And then we will crawl in the grass
Until lost in my mind
I am just losing myself

Now you see
Chasing the light
It's blowing right through the air
We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
Come on! We'll get on all fours
And then we will crawl in the grass
Until lost in my mind
I am just losing myself

Now you see
Chasing the light
It's blowing right through the air
We gonna keep on fighting for our dreams
Come on! We'll get on all fours
And then we will crawl in the grass
Until lost in my mind
I am just losing myself

I heard all the bells calling
Our nightmares of walls falling
You came back and gave your help
But you're lying on the ground
We turn back the tide of hell
And win back our fantasy
We fight for our right to be a free people again

And now we can see people shouting everywhere
So much blood shed I can't bear
I can not erase the words you said to me
But now you're dead
You will stand the endless rain
Wish I could have helped you more
When you died only the day before

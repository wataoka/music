Bells will be ringin'
The sad, sad news
Oh what a Chirstmas
To have the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends
To wish me greetings
Once again

Choirs will be singin'
”Silent Night”
Chirstmas calols
By candle light
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas
By new year's night

Friend and relations
Send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
For this is Christmas
It's the time of year to be
Wish the one you love

So won't you tell me
You'll never more roem
Christmas and New Year
Will find you home
There'll be no more sarrow
No grief and pain
And I'll be happy
Happy (Christmas) once again

So won't you tell me
You'll never more roem
Christmas and New Year
Will find you home
There'll be no more sarrow
No grief and pain
And I'll be happy
Happy (Christmas) once again

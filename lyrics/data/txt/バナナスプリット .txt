(Intro/Diggy-MO')
Alright, I'm sure y'all already know'em
But, let me introduce you to
Bro.Hi on tha ones and twos
Get inside a groove
DJ Mass on tha wheels of steel
Love music you know tha deal?!
Tha trackmaster Shinnosuke is on his keys
Just feel tha percussive programmin' beat
And I'm D on tha M.I.C

Hey, yei I make an essay
I'll take you to anotha space
人工衛星Far away
投げるんじゃなくて堕とすだけ
知的生命体溢れる球形Tha planet earth
I make you think today was a good day
ただそれだけ?!OK
So!

※(Hook/Diggy-MO')
BABY BABY JUST HAVE NO FEAR
I WILL CALL YOU WHEN I GET NEAR
HEY MACHINE! GO IN HIGH GEAR
GONNA STEP INTO THA NEW AREA
I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE EASIER
I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE FASTER
VISUALIZIN' A UTOPIA
NEVA WANNA GO TO DISTOPIA
I GUESS YOU'D SAY“SO WHAT??!”※

△(Bridge/Diggy-MO')
I'm always watchin' you and waitin' for your response
Gimme your reaction
On tha 6th Ave. My men carryin' on
Everybody's tryin' to add a new vibration
Just keep on hangin' tuff
And I'm starin' at tha sun△

(1st verse/Diggy-MO')
Wazz up! 聴いてるか This capriccio すごく濃く Toxic cut
Say wha! Such a sweet thing 妖精達が舞う
Get it togetha みんな遅れんな さぁ Just start!
When tha刺すようなwind blows y'all
get up to set up tha pillar of your soul
So, you know?! Studio じゃオペ完了 Dr.MINE's master stroke
T my friend あだ名パキラ make it fine
A peculiar flavor keep it up on tha regular
Mr.Ken5 checkin' tha key でピンときたら
Weekend でどう?じゃ金土
Singer, Ringer, Jingle しなやかな Finger tip たたく Finger board
Shin と Session 握る Mic We can go
Everybody wave your hands like this
Let's go! WA!!

(※くり返し)
(△くり返し)

(2rd verse/Bro.Hi)
Amen to that! you hit it! ご名答 Party people
playa-hater you gotta find your path
phat boys in tha house

And moove! side to side!

And shout! open your month

Everybody loud out!

(Inter/Diggy-MO')
C'mon Baby I made this BANANA SPLIT for you
C'mon and eat this 'Cuz It's so sweet

(3rd verse/Diggy-MO')
I'm in communication wit LiLA
Of course, 10 keys じゃ足んない Decipher
Lider測定可能
I'm Dyna-MO'
Animals of paradise like I've never seen
Body paintin' 原色 Primitive
Tha tribe dancin' 妖々と Flamin'
This is a STIMULUS
Free じゃないがDrink some and blaze it up!
Everybody is just snakin'
Deep Space から邪念なく放って Sparkle
Our planet is so beautiful
漆黒のDarkness 寂しさなんて Forget that
'Cuz you're so wonderful
So, show me your smile
Don't waste no time at all Your Dream I'll let it go
No evil in this world 呼び起こす Miracle
Everybody sing it Yo!

They can't stop my heart!!
Now get a party started alright!!
気まぐれに任せて
It's like wonderland
踏み出したらalright!!
Then I feel like I'm dreaming

Once upon a time
あるカドのFast food店で
"Excuse me. We'll have
2 coke please""alright"
勤めていた女の子は

かなり面白い夢を
こっそり企んでいて yeah…
"Did you finish mopping!?"
全て投げ捨てて未来へ
飛び出したのNow let me sing

They can't stop my heart!!
Now get a party started alright!!
思いを明日へ乗せ
It's like wonderland
手を伸ばせば alright!!
Then I feel like I'm dreaming

Where're my ladies at? 手上げてな
Clap Clap Clap
My boys Give me some love then
Clap Clap Clap
Party people Tear the roof up!
Now Clap Clap Clap
We're at the point まだ足んないなら
Clap Clap Clap Bring it back
Bang!!!! Here I come! Here I Here I come
Get up now みんなもっと踊って
Shake yo booty リズム乗って
(Check this out)
Let me take yo'll to the place yo'll never been before
目を醒ます様なの欲しいんでしょ?
もっとエッジ効かして 声聞かして
Say"OH YEAH"
Just like hamming birds in
感覚を潤わす World
See? My mind まだ止まんない
だって There comes the BOOM
分解して冷めないように
All night keep up with me
Now bounce up baby to the beat
Come on

They can't disturb us!!
描いたままに allnight
溢れ出す思いを
From one's heart to heart
伝えてゆけば alright!!
Do you wanna come in my dream?

We're going to the WEST!!
Come along party people!
Come along with us babe…
So fresh & So clean
But still putting it down for the street
We say "We're still in a dream…"
So when you see the sun is up
このままずっと
Yes!! Even sing it louder!
もっと聴かせていて
Let's get together! Com'on!

They can't stop my heart!!
Now get a party started alright!!
気まぐれに任せて
It's like wonderland
踏み出したら alright!!
Then I feel like I'm dreaming

They can't stop my heart!!
Now get a party started alright!!
思いを明日へ乗せ
It's like Wonderland
手を伸ばせば alright!!
Then I feel like I'm dreaming

They can't disturb us!!
描いたままに allnight
溢れ出す思いを
From one's heart to heart
伝えてゆけば alright!!

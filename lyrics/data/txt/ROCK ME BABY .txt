Love is what you make it
Come on baby take it
I'm just a fool in love with you

Don't you drive me crazy
I'll always want you baby
Tell me “honey”you're my girl

Oh baby, I wanna stay by your side
So come on let's take a ride
You know that I love you, I love you
I'll say I want you
I'll say I need you

Rock me baby
Rock me baby
Rock me baby
I'll say I want you
I'll say I need you
Rock me baby
Rock me everyday
Dancin' with you all night
I'll say I want you
I'll say I need you

Let's make love forever
We've got the power
I know we're gonna make it, yeah

Let me rock you, hold you
I've been thinking about you
Day & night that's all I do

Don't know why I feel I need you so
But I know I'll never let you go
You know that I love, I love
I'll say I want you
I'll say I need you

Rock me baby
Rock me baby
Rock me baby
I'll say I want you
I'll say I need you
Rock me baby
Rock me everyday
Dancin' with you all night
I'll say I want you
I'll say I need you

Love is what you make it
Come on baby take it
Tell me “honey”you're my girl
Tell me “honey”you're my girl

Oh baby, I wanna stay by your side
So come on let's take a ride
You know that I love you, I love you
Tell me “baby I love you”

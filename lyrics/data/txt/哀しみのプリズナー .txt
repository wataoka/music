さぁ部屋中を暗くてくれ
待ちわびた情念のSilence
Just one night we would be the same.
Oh oh oh, You & Me.
その容姿を照らすかのように
街並は永遠のViolence
Just one night we could play the game.
Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh.

翔べないこの手に
Do me a favor?  Give me the power.
夢のような 夜を抱いて
Hold on! Woo…

I've been running, I've been hot.
I've been burning, Oh oh on…
I've been waiting for ya.
Let's live on together.
I've been trying hang on, my love!!

失われた航海に
淋しげなBrothers & Sisters.
How could it come to be just fine.
Oh oh oh, Wait & See.
このホホを濡らすたびに
かげる太陽のAnswer
How could we try to make it shine.
Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh.

冷たい身体に
Do me a favor? Give me the power.
闇のような哀しみに
So long!! Woo…

I've been running, I've been hot.
I've been burning, Oh oh on…
I've been waiting for ya.
Let's live on together.
I've been trying hang on, my love!!

心に浮かぶ 瞳も泣いてる
抱きしめたら 消えゆくような
時代(とき)を見つめて

I'm waiting for someone.
You are the someone who holds me.

裸になれない都合のはずれで
ひとつになれるその日が来るなら

I've been running, I've been hot.
I've been burning, Oh oh on…
I've been waiting for ya.
Let's live on together.
I've been trying hang on, my love!!

言葉にならない痛みに震えて
生きぬくような この気持ちは
哀しみのPrisoner

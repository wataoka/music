Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

What you say?
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

Woman, oh, woman don't you treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
But I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go

That's right!
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

What you say?

Now baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet someday
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
You ain't got no money
You just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go

That's right!
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more

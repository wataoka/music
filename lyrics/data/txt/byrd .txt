He loves me like a child
Nobody nears us to see or hear
You say we are movin'
His words relax me
When I am restless in a storm,
he protects me
I breathe your air
I breathe deeply your love

Your love takes me away from reality
Sitting in the maps,
let's go on a voyage around the world
Control me
Don't leave me

Our boat drifts away the sea of dreams
I remember those times when I was lonely
felt like I din't want to be
just sitting out in rain
A lack of oxygen from my love
makes a hole in me

Rows of my tracks
bearing down on me
Our time cats our love
I'm alive
If all the dreams come true,
I seem so far away
Our cheeks nearly touch
Kick back and relax
Let's go on a voyage around the world

Our boat drifts away the sea of dreams
Happy together, come rain or come shine
Even if I am someone else walking down
a strange street, I must surely love you
I prize the feeling that cannot tell the words

I've got time for you forever

Little darlin', keep me warm
As time by, they change everything
round and round
The stars at night fade into morning time
So I'd better live my life

Little darlin', keep me warm
when we will find pinkmoon floating on the sea
round and round
Your kissin' lights me up
Your smilin' lights me up
Speaking with the pinkmoon only you can see

Happy together, come rain or come shine
Poor soul's not strong to gain, you know?
Sometime I'm worrying days and nights
I never forgive myself for your love, yo know?

I've got time for your forever

Little darlin', keep me warm
As time by, they change everything
round and round
The stars at night fade into morning time
So I'd better live my life

and try to be so strong

Little darlin', keep me warm
when we will find pinkmoon floating on the sea
round and round
I guess you are runnin' through my time
I've got time for you forever.

I choose carefully.
I waver in everything.
It also takes time for
me to buy one shirt.
That psychological test?
I couldn't enjoy myself well.

I choose carefully.
Indeed I'm serious.
Do you know my blood type?
Oh Yes, it's B.
I seem to be stubborn man.
So I can't also buy
a shirt today.

I'm geezer's man.
How should it be done?
I want to change this brain.
Or, I want to remove.
I am a hate figure.
How should it be done?
Everyone enjoys a life.
Though it's so,
I'm poor at that.

I can't choose a shirt yet.
So I'm Naked.
I feel cold, feel cold, feel cold,
feel cold and feel cold.
And I'm singing
this absurd song every night.

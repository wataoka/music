Life is running through from pole to pole
But only lights run through my heart and soul
Blood is running through the cityscape
People running too with no escape

So come stay here / Come stay near
So please be near / Be here

I don't know no perfect road,
but I will go wherever I need to
I can't see where I will be,
but I'll break free from whatever you chain to me

都会に灯火溢れ
血液の様に流れ
時には逃げたいけど
これが僕の血と故郷

So come stay here / Come stay near
So please be near / Be here

寝覚めのカフェインを求むようにたまらないわ
ぼんやりと優雅に光る君を愛してるんだわ

I can't see through all the lies and tricks
But the neon glows whenever I need my fix
I don't know no perfect road,
but I will go wherever I need to

ネオンの全てが消えたら残るものは
誰かに託した無条件な愛じゃないのか

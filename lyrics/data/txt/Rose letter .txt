Hello boy How have you been?
Here's some questions for you
You've never given me a rose seed, remember?
Has it come into flower in your field yet?
Good boy
Good night Sweet dreams
Good bye far away
Say hello to Mr. Justice, hello to Mr. Justice.
say hello to Mr. Justice
I wish you great happiness

Silly boy, How do vou feel?
Here's a little song for you
Loving you was an endless fight, you know
I never got a seed from you
And at that time, you get free to go to heaven
to hell
Good boy
Good night Sweet dreams
Good bye far away
Say hello to Mr. Justice, hello to Mr. Justice.
say hello to Mr. Justice
I wish you great happiness

Well, it's almost midnight now, so I'll close,
at last, here's a little song for you
with all my hurts

Good boy
Good night Sweet dreams
Good bye far away
Say hello to Mr.Justice

Good boy
Good night Sweet dreams
Good bye far away
Say hello to Mr. Justice, hello to Mr. Justice.
say hello to Mr. Justice
I wish you great happiness

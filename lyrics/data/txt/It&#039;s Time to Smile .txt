夕暮れをまとった輝きは 人ごみに消えてく
触れることなかったその頬は 違う手を温める
It's time to smile
It's not the time to cry

閉じ込めた言葉は お互いの胸の底 落ちてく
It's time to smile
It's not the time to cry

果てなく生まれるLove stories
どこかで目覚める はかないSweet dreams

It's time to smile
It's not the time to cry
It's time to smile それでいいさ

That's all I gotta do, that's all, that's all I do

花のようなドレスで歩き出す君に 笑顔送ろう
It's time to smile
It's not the time to cry
It's time to smile それでいいさ

It's time to smile
It's not the time to cry
It's time to smile それでいいさ

You don't need to worry 'bout me,
No worry 'bout me,
Stay as you are
You don't need to worry 'bout me,
No worry,
I know you will make all shinin' bright...

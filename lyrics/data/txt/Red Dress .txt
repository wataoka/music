The girl with the red dress,
She is standing just to confess.
Has an eye for fancy things,
He buys her diamond rings.
With high heels, just walking,
She has got everyone talking
About who is next in line,
To take her out, and dine.

She knows how it feels,
She makes all the world turn for her,
She knows,ooh! I know.
And he knows how it feels,
Not on his own, he is chasing at her,
He knows,ooh! Everyone knows.

"I love her, oh! I love her, I love her."

Spending everyday outside her doorway,
The light goes out, the window is open,
I hear her sleeping.
The ground below me never moves,
I'm stuck right here.
Wishing she would fly out with a rope,
To pull me near.

She don't know how I feel,
I would give up all my kingdom for her,
I know, ooh! I know.
And she knows how it feels,
She makes all the world turn for her,
She knows, I know.

Oh! I love her oh! I love her.
Looking at your window with the curtain slightly
Open there is a mirror.
And in that mirror I see a reflection
Of a cloth that is satin red.
Black car in the driveway, how does it feel?
I don't know.
A penguin with a bouquet, what does it mean?
I think I know.

He loves her? Yeah he loves her,
And she loves him! And I lost her.
Oh no!

Runnin'a race with the wind
Over and Over again
I may lose, pay my dues
But I swear that I won't give in
Puttin' my heart on the line
Provin' myself every time
Cry my tears' hide my fears
Hold my own, body,
soul, and mind
It's my life that live
It's my best I've got to give
Flyin' high on the
wings Of a dream

Nothing's gonna stop me now.
Let the rain come fallin' down
I believe I will find
The rainbow's end
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll get there someway, somehow
I believe I can win, oh yeah
I'm runnin',runnin' with the wind

One of these days, won't belong
I'll swallow my pride, carry on
Take the blows, heaven knows,
I've got love
and it makes me strong
Dark of night, heart of day
Nothing's standin' in my way
River deep,ocean wide mountain high

Nothing's gonna stop me now.
Let the rain come fallin' down
I believe I will find
The rainbow's end
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll get there someway, somehow
I believe I can win, oh yeah
I'm runnin',runnin' with the wind

The dark of night can't stop me
The mountain high can't stop me

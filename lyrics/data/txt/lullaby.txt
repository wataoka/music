the snow in the air
to sing me a lullaby
my winter, come hither to me 

the dark nights to come
so, kiss me for good-by
the grace of the goodland is near to you

show me the flowers invisible
sing me the hymns inaudible
the wind is my voice
the moon is my heart
come find me, I'm on every hills and fields
I'm here...ever your near.....
（sing for your love, gone so far in the past）
（pray for the world, that you may rest
　in perce）

the show in the air
to sing me a lullaby
the angel of rebirth is here

so let all your pain
sleep within the husha-by
the grace of the godland
grace of the godland
grace of the godland is near.....
so close to you

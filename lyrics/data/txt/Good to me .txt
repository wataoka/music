I'm on the way
風の blue days
Day after day
それも OK
You won't believe
いずれ good time
I used to be..
これも alright
愛から成るなら揺らいでも
君は beautiful

悲しみは lonely
But, it's only a different kind of love
涙とか lovely  明日へ slowly
願うなら行けるだろう
想いは this time

I know it's good to me
Let's drive in life together
I know it's good to me
Life is getting better and better
愛が見えない霧の日も holiday
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you wanna baby
Have a good time ?

Well on the way
君の new days
Time goes by
それも OK
想い出の全てが
愛に変わるのさ beautiful

7days a week
虹の suitcase
Forever more
行こう alright
だいたい未来は
君が決められる tomorrow

一人きり lonely
But, it's only another side of love
淋しさも lovely  やがて slowly
時が経って smile
I say,
We are on the way
Time will pass away
I know it, by the way
Oh, darling, love is forever

I know it's good to me
Let's fall in love together
I know it's good to me
Life is getting better and better
涙拭えない雨の日も honey taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you wanna baby
Have a good time ?

Come on, baby
Let's have a good time

I know it's good to me
Let's drive in life together
I know it's good to me
Life is getting better and better
愛が見えない霧の日も holiday

Oh!
I know it's good to me
Let's fall in love forever
I know it's good to me
Life is getting better and better
涙拭えない雨の日も honey taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you wanna baby
Have a good time ?

Don't you wanna baby
Have a good time ?

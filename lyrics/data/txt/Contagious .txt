Hey! 無敵のbright man 話を聞いてくれよ
役には立たないだろうが話を聞いてくれよ bright man
Oh, may be fairy tales
For you, must be meaningless

まわりの誰もがみんな自分を嘆いて生きてる
同時に誰もがみんな自分を蹴り上げ這い回る

Oh, the one and only way
Yes! だからもがくのさ
Oh, until we get to the place sometime

It's Contagious. No refuse. Never die. Never die.
Do you think that we are foolish men 止まれないのさ
The Contagious. It's taking me to the end. To the end.
Do you feel it's a foolish game?
何かがまた駆り立てるのさ

We are sailing, we are sailing
Toward the light that we needed
We are callin g, we are calling
To the place that we want to stay

Oh, maybe fairy tales
Yes! だからもがくのさ
For you, must be meaningless
Oh, the one and only way
Yes! 今日も もがくのさ
Oh, until we get to the place sometime

It's Contagious. No refuse. Never die. Never die
Do you think that we are foolish men 止まれないのさ
The Contagious. It's taking me to the end. To the end
Do you feel it's a foolish game?
何かがまた駆り立てるのさ

No refuse, no refuse
Never die, never die

It was suspicious days
I lost sight of an enemy
I did not notice the pit
[I am foolish…]
put an end to stillness
I can't yet die
[I can't miss the eyes from fate]

This bullet is all openings
Don't forget the meaning that pulled a trigger
I bet all on this bullet
Don't forget the feelings that pulled a trigger
Hesitating means death

[Countless tears] [Timeless scene] [Nameless liberty]
I still remember it
Because I more strongly than anyone prayed
I believe it

Even if my dream fails
Even if my throat breaks off
This song continues living
I give all
「This is fate」

Even if my dream fails
Even if my throat breaks off
This song continues living
刻み付けるように…
Even if my body breaks off
This song continues living
I give all
「This is fate」

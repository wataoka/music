Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit
before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long, long time ago,
your mother should know, your mother should know.
Sing it again:
Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit
before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long, long time ago,
your mother should know, your mother should know.
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
that was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long, long time ago,
your mother should know, your mother should know.
Your mother should know, your mother should know.
Sing it again:
Da da da da da da da da da da da da
da da da da da da da da.
Though she was born a long, long time ago,
your mother should know, your mother should know.
Your mother should know, your mother should know.
Your mother should know, your mother should know.

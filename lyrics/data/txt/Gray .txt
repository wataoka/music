I'm here to make you smile and make you stay.
I sing “La la lalalala”

I say NO to symbols and gray.
I know what I really want.
Hey,am I in a fairytale?

I see me falling into where I really wanted to be.
Such a pain I'm waiting for you.

Where's my time, my sleep, my heart.
You stole every little thing from me.

Just wanna see you all the time.
Please don't you hate me for that.

So baby, let me see it clear.
Our story's got us going.

Symbols ain't gonna tell it right.
It's so crazy counting on them.

Gray is not the color for me.
Tell me what you see in me.

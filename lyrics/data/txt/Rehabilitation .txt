When noticing, I got an age a lot.
But my mind was while being childish.
‘I don't change'
I thought so for a long time.
But I became weak from the day
when you have left.

And my born flash was very easy.
‘Well, I will go traveling!'
I'm so strange to think of.
The new wear, new shoes
and new friends.
Can I be normally?

It's hard on me to hear your recent rumor.
My mind was confused with a small topic.
I drank deep brown whiskey every day.
And I made many lonely songs.
That's for myself.

And I traveled actually.
It isn't better to hold still.
I think I become a little fine.
The new wind, new town and new song.
Can I be normally?

I'm writing the letter to you
which is never sent now.
I know. I know.
I'm not supposed to lose a morbid drive.

And I traveled actually.
It isn't better to hold still.
I think I become a little fine.
The new wind, new town and new song.
Can I be normally?

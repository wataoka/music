I've been asking to myself,
What this crazy feeling means to me?
I need so much more than I can give
Trying not to think of you
Tell me where you have been hiding out
There must be something I can do

Suddenly,I realize the way to go from now on
I can see,now
Wanna do I wanna do
Take you all the way now

You are the reason I'm alive
I can't take this any longer honey,please don't say good-bye
Remember the night I held you tight
Before you go make me cry
Can't you just change your mind?

I've been talking to myself,
What this dizzy feeling means to me?
You need so much more than you can give
Trying not to look for you
Tell me what you have been keeping up
There must be somewhere I can go

Finally,I realize the way to go from now on
I can feel,now
Wanna do I wanna do
Take you all the way now

I am the reason you're alive
I can't take this any longer honey,don't leave me alone
Remember the night I held you tight
Befor you go play on me
Speak with your true mind
Just one wish,before you deny yourself
Stay with me,till I get high enough

You are the reason I'm alive
Remember the night I held you tight
Before you go make me cry
Can't you just change your mind?
Just one wish,before you deny yourself
Stay with me,till I get high enough

Love won't bring me down

Love can make me all better
Love can make me all right
Love can give me wings to fly
C'mon babe, let's get high

Love can make you all better
Love can make you all right
Love can give you wings to fly
C'mon babe, let's get high
Fly 'round in the sky

Love won't let you be, girl
Grab my hand

It can be you and me
We can take it nice and slow
It can be you and me
Love can be nice and slow

Love can be forever
Love can be forever, girl

I can make you feel better
I can make you feel right
Don't you think about forever?
We can make it there tonight
C'mon babe, let's get high
Fly 'round in the sky

Love won't let you be, girl
Grab my hand

Love won't let you be, girl
Be with me tonight

It can be you and me
We can take it nice and slow
It can be you and me
Love can be nice and slow

Love can be forever
Love can be forever, girl

Love won't bring me down

It can be you and me
We can take it nice and slow
It can be you and me
Love can be nice and slow
Babe you are the one for me
So let's let the loving flow

Love can be forever
Love can be forever, girl

手ぶらのまま 裸足でいよう
ビートはそのまま さざ波のよう
赤道の上 踊る太陽
ステップかるく あの虹を越えよう

寝そべってる 目の前の日々
虹の向こうにいる 愛してる君
手ぶらのまま 裸足で
そう
ステップかるーく あの虹を越えよう

You. You have to walk your way to get your love
Yeah Don't you know your way?
Searching for love.

まじめに見て わたしの夢よ
夕方頃まで 消えないうちに
走れ七色 柔らかい願い
雨上がりなら 迷わないわ

from the heart is what's from in me - Here!!/

here we go, here we go, here we go now!!/

You. You have to walk your way to get your love
Yeah Don't you know your way?
Searching for love.

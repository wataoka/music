I saw your face in a mirror tonight
I hed a feeling when I walked in the light
You act so strange when we're on our own
Am I a fool in love or am I alone

I dream alone but babe your right up inside
I wake up crying cause I know that you lied
Something about this tells me you're not true
Don't want to lose you（baby）but what can I do

Please hold me tight, everynight
Just whisper that you love me
I want your love, need your love
I will never ever leave you
Please hold me tight, everynight
Promise me we'll stay together
I want your love, need your love
Please tell me I'm your girl

Still I'm afraid that when two lovers fight
When one is wrong, that makes the other one right
If I'm to blame tell me right from the start
I can't take no more of this, don't play with my heart

I dream alone but babe your nght up inside
I wake up crying cause I know that you lied
Something about this tells me your not true
Don't want to lose you baby but what can I do

Please hold me tight, everynight
Just whisper that you love me
I want your love, need your love
I will never ever leave you
Please hold me tight, everynight
Promise me we'll stay together
I want your love, need your love
Please tell me I'm your girl

I want your love, hold me tight
Hold me tight, yeah, yeah.....

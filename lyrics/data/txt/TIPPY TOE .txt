(Chorus)
Every time I think about you
Heaven knows I fall into a groove
You've like a great interlude
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer
Cuz you're married and you've even got a family too
Pray that they don't hear you
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe (ooh)
What a perfect life they think you've got, right?
Problems kept inside, look neat and organized
What you need in life is some wonder
A new friend with vision like you
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
Stay very close to the floor
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
Careful when you close the door
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
When we tippy toe,tippy toe (Just imagine)
My body under your body
Here we go everybody 3, 2, 1
Chorus

When the thrill subsides,will you still be mine?
Worry infiltrates my head till I kill it
I fill it instead with improper visions of you
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
Stay very close to the floor
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
Careful when you close the door
Nobody has to know (Synchronjze it)
When we tippy toe,tippy toe
Nobody has toknow, body screaming MORE
On your mark set 3, 2, 1
Chorus(2Ã—)

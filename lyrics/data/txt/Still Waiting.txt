Counting the hours
Time goes by, nothing matters
Sitting alone in the night
Music is playing
Life goes on, but I'm dying
My heart is longing for my lover

The same old table, and the same old dress
I come here everyday and hope that you'll be there
I'm waiting, I'm making conversation to you all by myself
And you'll promise that you'll never leave me

Drowning in memories, too much bourbon and whiskey
I am still waiting for my lover

See my reflection
As I stare out the window
Wishing that you were here tonight
Lost in your shadow
In the arms of another
My body's yeaming for my lover

They say I'm crazy, have I lost my mind
Oh, no, I won't deny that I still love you so
I'm waiting, heart's breaking
I am searching but you're not anywhere
I am praying, won't you come back and free me

No one can save me, only you make me happy
I am still waiting for my lover

I still remember all the things you said
How your heart was set to never let me go
I'm waiting, am I fading
Disappearing each time I close my eyes
Did you love me at least once or was I dreaming?
Wolking the streets
I don't know where or what am I doing,
I am still waiting for my lover

Counting the hours
Time goes by, nothing matters
I am still waiting for my lover

Drowning in memories
Too much bourbon and whiskey
I am still waiting for my lover

I am still waiting for my lover

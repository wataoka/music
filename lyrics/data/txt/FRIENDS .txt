You have a king of the power (right hand)
Yeah you got it
Somebody might be a flower
Yeah you got it
It's time to get ready
All you have really time to share
(All you have to do is make some friends)
Take your chance

It could be the whole of the problem change
your body
But I need you to be stronger than anyone
It's time now to speed up
All you have to do is make some friends

We might be just like a bird in the cage
How could I reach to your heart?
Coming soon
How can you dance like a clown in the tent?
You can change your self
until you'll find the seventh friend

Here we go
Come with me (Shaking the ground)
Then you open your mind
(Then you open your self)
Here we go
Moving on
Grooving on
Grooving on
Then we know
We never see each other again
Just look so fine
All of your friends with hearts

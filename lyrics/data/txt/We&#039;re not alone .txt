Sunlight was the only thing that felt right before I came here
But inside it feels like it keeps raining
And every drop is like the tears we couldn't cry
Because outside we were all alone
But this place gave us something that somehow made us strong

If there's a place inside this world
Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost
We'll stand as one against these walls
And fight this fight forevermore

Sometimes I feel this anger changing slowly in to
A monster that keeps on creeping under
And I don't think I can take anymore
I need your help like never before
But can you hear me call?

If there's a place inside this world
Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost
We'll stand as one against these walls
And fight this fight forevermore
If there's a place inside this world
Where we must go back to once more
Until the day we find that place
We're not alone

When things go bad
When things go wrong
When on the verge of letting go
There's something that I really want you to know

You're not alone anymore

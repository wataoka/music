Pray God you can cope 
I stand outside this woman's work,
This woman's world 
Ooh, it's hard on the man 
Now his part is over 
Now starts the craft of the father. 
  
I know you have a little life in you yet 
I know you have a lot of strength left 
I know you have a little life in you yet 
I know you have a lof of strength left 
I should be crying but I just can't let it show 
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking 
Of all the things I should've said 
That I never said, 
All the things we should've done 
That we never did, 
All the things I should've given 
But I didn't 
Oh, darling, make it go, 
Make it go away. 
  
Give me these moments back 
Give them back to me 
Give me that little kiss 
Give me your hand. 
  
I know you have a little life in you yet 
I know you have a lot of strength left 
I know you have a little life in you yet 
I know you have a lof of strength left 
I should be crying but I just can't let it show 
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking 
Of all the things we should've said 
That we never said,
All the things we should've done 
That we never did,
All the things that you needed from me 
All the things that you wanted for me 
All the things I should've given 
But I didn't 
Oh, darling, make it go away, 
Just make it go away now.

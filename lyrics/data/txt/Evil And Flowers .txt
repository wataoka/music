You can find evil everywhere
aiming at your flowers
Run and run and hide as you may,
they will catch you

They're always ready in your mind
No man alive can see them
They show Themselves as flowers fall
then you must go

go somewhere to find yourself
if you cannot help yourself
thought evil and flowers both come and go

You shall find no choice anyway
passing vacant hours
kinda long for you to tide over
who knows where to belong

We're always petrified and tied
wish I could climb a ladder
dark night,dark night will come over soon
then you must go

go somewhere to find yourself
if you cannot help yourself
though evil and flowers both come and go
evil and flowers

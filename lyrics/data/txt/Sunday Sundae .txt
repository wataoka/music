I just wanna be with you on Sunday 
恋をしたの Sunday 夢みたのも Sunday 
Don't let me leave alone 

Just wanna be with you on Sunday 
ソファーに寝ころんで ちょっと拗ねてる Sunday 
Don't let me leave alone 

I'm in love & That made me like a girlhood 
Yes I don't know why 

Just wanna be with you on Sunday 
恋をしたの Sunday 夢みたのも Sunday 
Don't let me leave alone 

Just wanna be with you 
Just wanna be with you on Sunday 
受話器に手をかけて ちょっと待ってる Sunday 
Don't let me leave alone 

Break this silence, please 

Now I need you

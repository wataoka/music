At the midnight mass 眠る事もなく
行ったり来たりのbasic attitude
I've got my vision 望みはクリアー
消える事なきdesert fire

I don't need no salvation ロジックだけじゃ生きられない
I don't need no meditation
Gain ground! Out of here!
Like the nonstop train

Wax & Wane 迷う事もなく
行ったり来たりのactual attitude

I don't need no salvation フィードバックだけじゃ超えられない
I don't need no meditation
Gain ground! Out of here!
Like the thunder storm

In the dead of night
Passion fire in my heart is burning me up
My basic attitude
I don't know if right or wrong, but make my way
In the dead of night
Beacon fire in my heart is burning me down
My actual attitude
I don't know if right or wrong, but make my day

I don't need no salvation ロジックだけじゃ生きられない
I don't need no meditation, yeah
I don't need no salvation フィードバックだけじゃ超えられない
I don't need no meditation
Gain ground! Out of here!
Like the thunder storm

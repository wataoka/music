Get out of my way まだ彷徨える垂れ流しの日々よ
今はもう遠く手の届かない置き去りのmy story
Paint it black! Paint it red! ただ泥にまみれながら
To the dark! To the dawn! また時は流れゆく

Don't you know that I'm crying, I can't find my way
Now I'm dying, I feel it inside
Remains of my shadows, where are they now?
I don't know

Get out of my sight 終わる事なき原色のmy story
Turn it on! Turn it off! また時が消えてゆく

Don't you know that I'm trying, I can't find my way
Now I'm dying, I feel no breath
Remains of my daydreams, where are you now?
I don't know

Down! I'm going down
Oh, am I missing something? What shall I do?
Now! My time is bending
My ears are ringing, screaming
I don't know what I'm fighting for?

You won't know that I'm trying, I can't find the key
Now I'm dying, no shine, there's no sight
Oh, my daydreams, where are you now?
Can't see, can't feel

Down! I'm going down
Oh, am I missing something? What shall I do?
Now! My time is bending
My ears are ringing, screaming
Again and again and again and again

Down! I'm going down
Oh, am I missing something? What can I do?
Now! The sky is burning
My ears are ringing, screaming
Again and again and again

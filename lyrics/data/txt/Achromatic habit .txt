Hello, buddy alone
Maybe like me

Hello, buddy alone
Like me
I'm waiting for you, in myself

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
The shadow, although it is morning

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
The shadow, although it is morning now

Hello, buddy alone
Maybe like me

Hello, buddy alone
Like me
I'm writing this for you, in myself

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
The shadow, although it is morning

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
The shadow, although it is morning now

夢で見た景色の様な
哀しい空を夕べ見上げていたんだ
果てなく続く街に灯が
煌めく宝石みたいに続いてた

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow, the shadow

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
Where's my shadow?

鳥が空を飛び回るように
自由なんだ僕らも今は

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
The shadow, although it is morning

In the morning rain
Staying under rain again
No shadow, my shadow,
The shadow, although it is morning now

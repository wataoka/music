A swollen style melts us in silence
We have been stuck at the bottom of time so far

Breathing in, breathing out talking with the moon
The cell sound is caught let's let it go from here

I'm feeling the sense of being one
I'm feeling the sense of being one
The moment of being connected
The moment of being free

My feelings came here passing through another space
passing through another time.asking for a resonance
Everything will be one with the space
and the space will be one with everything

A swollen style melts us in silence
We have been stuck at the bottom of time

Breathing in, Breathing out talking with the trees
The air wave is caught let's let it go

I'm feeling the sense of being one
I'm feeling the sense of being one
The moment of being connected
The moment of being free

Your feelings came here passing through another space
passing through another time,asking for a resonance
Everything will be one with the space
and the space will be one with everything

My feelings came here passing through another space
passing through another time.asking for a resonance
Everything will be one with the space
and the space will be one with everything

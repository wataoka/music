The moment I almost reached the shore
Current pulled me out further
I know
This love was built to never last
But I'm still drowning in the past

I don't just want your love
I'm a fiend and you're a drug
I could never ever get enough
I tried to give you up
But the damage has been done
As long as you exist I'll never stop

A lonely boy like you
I'm on my way
I'm gonna rescue you

Drowning in your love
Wasting away
I thought you'd throw me a life raft
But you just sailed away
Lost at sea
Flooded by memories
The more the tides change
The more things stay the same
I can't stay but I can't get away
Come save me

I caught a boat and sailed to shore
But I swam right back out for more...
yeah

I don't just want your love
I'm a fiend and you're a drug
I could never ever get enough
I tried to give you up
But the damage has been done
And truthfully I don't wanna stop

A lonely girl like me
Who's on their way?
Who's gonna rescue me?

Drowning in your love
Wasting away
I thought you'd throw me a life raft
But you just sailed away
Lost at sea
Flooded by memories
The more the tides change
The more things stay the same
I can't stay but I can't get away

I should sever the anchor
Get back on my feet
And salvage what's left of me
Demo ne, demo ne
This lonliness suits me quite well
Don't you think? yeah yeah

Drowning in your love
Wasting away
I thought you'd throw me a life raft
But you just sailed away
Lost at sea
Flooded by memories
The more the tides change
The more things stay the same

Drowning in your love
Wasting away
I thought you'd throw me a life raft
I thought you still loved me
Lost at sea
Flooded by memories
The more the tides change
The more things stay the same
I can't stay but I can't get away
Come save me

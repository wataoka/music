Everyone's looking for something real
Everyone's taking all they can steal

Brother to sister
Look at each other
Face to face

There's something missing here
In this human race

In side me (All we want is something real)
Is a part of you (We can make this last forever)
And inside you (Make a world that we can feel)
There's a part of me (We will always be together)

Person to person place to place
We run from each other lost in the race

Brother to sister
Hold on to each other
We've all we got

Our time is coming
If we're ready or not
If we're ready or not

In side me (All we want is something real)
Is a part of you (We can make this last forever)
And inside you (Make a world that we can feel)
There's a part of me (We will always be together)
In side me (All we want is something real)
Is a part of you (We can make this last forever)
And inside you (Make a world that we can feel)
There's a part of me (We will always be together)

Brother to sister
Hold on to each other
We've all we got

In side me (All we want is something real)
Is a part of you (We can make this last forever)
And inside you (Make a world that we can feel)
There's a part of me (We will always be together)
In side me (All we want is something real)
Is a part of you (We can make this last forever)
And inside you (Make a world that we can feel)
There's a part of me (We will always be together)

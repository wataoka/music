With you these streets are heaven
Now home feels so foreign
They told me I was mistaken, infatuated
And I was afraid to trust my hunches
Now I am ready
Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving
Please let me worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
This is my story
(Chorus)
Through mountains high and valleys low
The ocean, through the desert, snow
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know
This is our Exodus '04
Through traffic jams in Tokyo
New music on the radio
We'll say goodbye to the world we know
This is our Exodus '04
Landscapes keep changing
History teaches something
I know I could be mistaken, but my heart has spoken
I cannot redirect my feelings
The waves have parted
Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving
Please let me worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
This is my story
Chorus
I'm listening to a music never ending
My baby don't you know I'll never let you down
You've opened me to so many different endings
But baby I know that you'll always be around
Chorus

You guys do not notice that we are gifted just by being humans
We are absolute predators
We do not even have any enemies
Maybe there are other animals watching us
and thinking that someday　“we will beat them down”

Oh We have the brains to think hard
Wear our favorite clothes
We are at no doubt human beings
Many small lives
They were born
[They were born]
with the fate
[with the fate]
of dying for someone
[for someone A human baby]
A human baby
When will they find out
[When will they find out the true fact yeah]
that at the point they were born, we are
[we are winners]
(the)　winners of Earth

ああ　ひとり泣いていた　となりのきみが問いかける
だから僕ら寄り添い生きる　煌めくまで

When will I find out the answer?
An answer that is only for you
What will myself and　(the)　first scenery I saw
Look like?
It's my face, my face

Shut up! I read this inside the book I read before
[The book I read before]
According　(to)　Maslow
[According　(to)　Maslow]
There are five steps　(in a)　human's desire

To live a long long life to stay safe and to receive
[Baby]
love from others
To get respect from
[Baby]
others, To get closer
[Yeah]
to your ideal
[Yeah]
That's what it said
[Yeah]
No matter how hard other animals try, they probably can't go over the first step
That is how intelligent we are and,　(an animal)　filled with greed
But that is probably why we can still live on the top of the food chain
in this blue planet although we have weak bodies

ああ　また君の目に　いつもの朝が　映り込む
流れる　涙が　きえてゆく

For what to live for
Think deeply as you live yeah
Cuz you humans are　(the)　only ones that can do this on Earth

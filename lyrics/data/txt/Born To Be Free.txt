No more runnin's for cover
We've got one another
One sweet dream we can borrow
At least until tomorrow

Well we made it this far
there ain't no stopping us now
Some people say there's no way to win
We will anyhow

★We were born to be free
　We make our own destiny
　We'll live and love as we please
　'Cuz we were born to be free

Deep in the heart of darkness
We found the luckiest star
Kiss me baby, let's get started
We're goin' just as we are

★★In the heat of the night
　　（when）There ain't nobody around
　　Makin' a break for the light
　　Till dawn comes tumblin' down

★Repeat
★★Repeat
★Repeat and fade

The meaning of my life, I'm not so sure
Life is too short to figure out that

So long time
I've been searching for something
The existence of my own could be blessed for another
Maybe you're right
I'm little impractical
But don't just roll your eyes
Cause I can change your world
Or maybe it's you to save my heart

Tiny Star
Round and round
Twinkling in the sky
So fleeting and bright
Look ud and let's count them one, two, three…
Beautiful world
Where we belong
Feeling like I'm a piece of the universe
Realize how powerless I am
Tiny Star
When you cry
I will fly up there and hold you tight
I'll always be there to make you smile
Tiny Star
I hold your hand
Try a little harder
To be strong enough for you

No one's gonna know what's in my future
Either right or wrong, I'll seek where to go

I wonder
Why do I realize that something is so precious after they've gone
Just one of those days, so ordinary and boring
But after all I know there were full of hope
In this crazy mixed up world

Tiny Star
Round and round
Twinkling in the sky
So fleeting and bright
Look ud and let's count them one, two, three…
Beautiful world
Where we belong
Feeling like I'm a piece of the universe
Realize how powerless I am
Tiny Star
When you cry
I will fly up there and hold you tight
I'll always be there to make you smile
Tiny Star
I hold your hand
Try a little harder
To be strong enough for you

Don't you look back
We never go back to the past
Head up to the sky and feel the vast beautiful world

Tiny Star
Round and round
Twinkling in the sky
So fleeting and bright
Look ud and let's count them one, two, three…
Beautiful world
Where we belong
Feeling like I'm a piece of the universe
Realize how powerless I am
Tiny Star
When you cry
I will fly up there and hold you tight
I'll always be there to make you smile
Tiny Star
I hold your hand
Try a little harder
To be strong enough for you

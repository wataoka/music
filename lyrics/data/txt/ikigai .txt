so much to say, so little time and
I don't want to waste another day
fussing wasting precious moments
when we can be alive and loving
holding on to what has brought us here together.

one day some years ago in all the madness
I found one bit of truth in a smile in a song, yeah
Went on singing this song but the smile was fading
time keeps on rolling on, can this be how it ends.

sometimes I just don't know why
I feel like I've been so blind all through my life
but when nights keep getting colder
we gotta remember we've only got each other

you're hanging on one single
thread of hope that's all you got
but know that anywhere you go and though tears won't stop
somebody loves you and they're
holding onto the same single thread
searching for the same light.

some days I find myself lost in all the madness
I feel like giving in. Is there a way to get a way, oh
so there's another day gone the same old story
I don't mind some heartache now and then, but then again

I say go, you say slow down
sometimes we expect so much we're losing ground
I can be at times a bit uptight
but we gotta remember we've only got each other

you're hanging on one single
thread of hope that's all you got
but know that anywhere you go and though tears won't stop
somebody loves you and they're
holding onto the same single thread
searching for the same light.

so much to say, so little time and
I don't want to waste another day
fussing wasting precious moments
when we can be alive and loving
holding on to what has brought us here together.

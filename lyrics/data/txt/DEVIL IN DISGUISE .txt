Just when you start believing
She'll tell you goodbye
There's no doubt you won't be hearing
One good reason why

She'll leave you in the rain
She doesn't care about the tears you'll cry
She's gonna shatter all your hopes and dreams
Leaving you hung up to dry

Girl can be cruel I have seen it
Listen to me and believe it
Don't think that she really means it
Girl is just a devil in disguise

Don't be taken in by magic
Don't look in her eyes
That's the moment when she casts her spell
So here's a word to the wise

She'll only bring you pain
Then she'll move on to another guy
what can I say to make you understand
It ends the same way every time

Girl can be cruel I have seen it
Listen to me and believe it
Don't think that she realy means it
Girl is just a devil in disguise

Yes I am one of those
One of many hearts she chose
It's a wonder that my soul somehow survived
Let me impart to you
Certain things I've learned are true
She'll convince you that your love belongs to her
Don't concur
Just defer
And you'll go on
So long her

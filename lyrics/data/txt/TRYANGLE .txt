Everybody has their weakness
誰もみなLoneliness but
To share them with somebody is always little hard
And if we need the "face to face"
向きあうのはThat's so shameだから
いつも同じ方を向いてWalkin'on, Walkin'on

It was a summer night when we looked up to the sky
It was a precious melody, yeah
Suddenly, oh flashing so bright

Tryangle stars, Tryangle lights
The stars we found in the darkest night
We heard the sound from up above
We're now here to describe its beauty

We can't say we have no troubles
We can't say it was very peaceful
The time we started to create that brand-new ship
To show the honest heart to you
If we could do it straight through, no-no
照れ隠しのBehind there's a massive love, massive love

Always we got to go a long way round to tell you some
Always we got to go a long way round to tell you some yeah
This is what we are

Tryangle stars Tryangle lights
Finally, we arrived to land
But the goal we stand is the start line
"Tryangle bound" the train is on the way

Oh yeah
And life is once for everyone
People afraid to fail their way
We got to try our own angle
To shoot the star, to shoot the super star
Tryangle stars, Tryangle lights
The stars we found in the darkest night
We heard the sound from up above
We're now here to describe its beauty

TRYANGLE In the edge of the night, let me talk about how we were born
Everybody has their weakness
Sometimes we smile but inside there is a speechless loneliness
The issue I 直視せず Kind of a rich man, maind is a homeless
けれど同じ方むいて視線揃えてくならSure we'll take a right way
It was a summer night, in the darkest night,
We found the precious starlight was some say that 夏の大三角という星座
We gazed that and the melody suddenly flying down like a ceremony, oh
We saw that it has begun, ALTIMA has become as one
So now, party people, Let's try this brand-new angle

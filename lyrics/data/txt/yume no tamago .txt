When can you look the truth of the dream
When can you touch the truth of the love
So can you feel the voice callin' you
In the far distance

Nothing is real, nothing is eternity
Nothing is all, nothing is innocence
Nothing is truth, nothing is answer
Keep sleeping yet

The sky is high, the dark is deep
The depth is waiting for the time
Across to find the truth of the world
Ah Rahxephon fly me to the music

Living is dazzle, living is distance
Living is puzzle, living is sadness
Living is prayer, living is question
Keep silence yet

The circle is closed by a quiet song
The circle is purified for you
Across to find the truth of the world
Ah Rahxephon fly me to the music

When can you touch the truth of the dream
So can you feel forever......

O mother dear
Look what you've done
To your forlorn and once beloved son
Why was I born at all?
O mother dear
I'm such a freak
A mutant man, a woman underneath
Why was I born at all?

It's you I blame for all the shame
This anguish and this aching
The mirror turned against the wall
Myself despised, forsaken

★
You say,“Beauty is within us, your mother knows”
“There's a beauty that's within us, just like a rose”
You say,“beauty is within us, so let it grow”
But it's grown so dark and ugly

O mother dear
I curse you so
For breathing life into your wretched son
Why were you born at all?
O mother dear
I love you so
O please forgive this anger in my soul
Without you I'm alone

It's me who's been eternally damned
Trapped inside this cage, a ruined man
All damaged and depraved

O mother dear
This misery
Has settled like a stain upon my skin
-a vast unspoken sin

And my mistake is much too late
But your mistake was trusting
That out of grief, a goodness comes
And love comes out of lusting

You say,“Beauty is within us, your mother knows”
“There's a beauty that's within us, just like a rose”
You say,“Beauty is within us, so let it grow”
But it's grown so dark I can not see you anymore

“O beauty is within us, mother knows”
“O beauty is within us, like a rose”
“O beauty is within us, let it grow”
O mother dear, let me out of here!

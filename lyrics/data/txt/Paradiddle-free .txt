A cliche to rephrase
Holding it inside
Dancing to unite
Afterword is absourd
Two pages ago
I wasn't home

Don'be sad
We'd better not make nose, bang bang bang
We'd better not say a word a word a word
We'd better not
Today is a paradiddle-free day

An Excuse to refuse
Leaving it unsaid
I'm kissing you instead
Afterglow makes me go
You try to heal your sore
Then I can love you more

I'm not mad but
We'd better not hesitate, right left right
We'd better not say a word a word a word
We'd better not
Today is a paradiddle-free day

I'm so used to waiting for your decision
Don't even try to pretend that you made up your mind
We're born to question every single day, but
Not everything's about ”Yes or No”
We need a break sometimes sometimes

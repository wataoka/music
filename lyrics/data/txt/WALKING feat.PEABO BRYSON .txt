今までのすべてが 心によみがえる WOW WOW
笑ってた 泣いていた 悔しさを握りしめて

愛も夢もあって いつも追いかけ続けていた WOW WOW
つまずいて誰かに邪魔されて 傷ついたあの頃も

WALKING ON THE ROAD MY LIFE 今も
歩き続けてる
I LOVE THE PLACE I'M WALKING どれも
全てが今に繋がってるんだ

"輝き"の影には不安 押し寄せるばかりで WOW WOW
尖ってた 強がっていた それは怯えてたから

WALKING ON THE ROAD MY LIFE とても
厳しい道のりさ
I LOVE THE PLACE I'M WALKING だけど
後悔してもしょうがない・・・進もう!

WALKING ON THE ROAD MY LIFE とても
厳しい道のりさ
I LOVE THE PLACE I'M WALKING だけど
後悔してもしょうがない・・・進もう!!

SEEN SO MANY PLACES IN MY LIFE
HAD SO MANY PEOPLE COME MY WAY
SOME STAYED A WHILE
WHILE SOME RAN ASTRAY
BUT I JUST KEEP ON WALKING MY OWN WAY

PEOPLE TRY AND TELL US HOW TO LIVE
OUR OWN LIVES
AND OTHERS TRY AND TELL US WHO TO BE
I'VE ALWAYS DONE, ALL THAT I BELIEVE
NOW MY LIFE REFLECTS WHAT'S INSIDE ME

WALKING ON THE ROAD THAT TAKES ME HERE
ALONG THE WAY WE OFTEN CHANGE
WE SEE SO MANY THINGS THAT WERENT SO CLEAR
BUT THEN WE FIND THAT
LIFE ALWAYS HAS・・・・ ANOTHER WAY

I'VE LEARNT FROM ALL THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
AT DIFFERENT TIMES
I'VE GROWN FROM EVERY CORNER I SUSTAINED
AND LOOKING BACK NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW
I'M EXACTLY WHO I WANT TO BE

I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT IS YET TO COME,
I'M NOT DONE
THE WONDERS OF MY DREAMS WILL YET UNFOLD
I STAND OPEN ARMED, WITH NEWNESS TO START
THE DREAMS I'LL MAKE WALKING ON MY ROAD

WALKING ON THE ROAD I FOUND MY WAY
THAT'S HOW I'M STANDING HERE TODAY
I'VE TAKEN SOMETHING WITH ME ALONG THE WAY
NOW I LOVE ALL THAT
IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT!・・・ I'M HERE TODAY

たとえようもない程 辛く切ない夜を超え
WALKING ON THE ROAD THAT TOOK ME HERE
歩き続けて行く
I'LL KEEP ON WALKING THOUGH I CAN'T FORSEE
JUST WHERE I'M GOING BUT THAT'S OK
・・・I WALK MY WAY
・・・I WALK MY WAY

WALKING ON MY ROAD.
WALKING THIS IS MY LIFE.

Tell me babe, how many do I shed my tears?
Every Heart Every Heart is not a gentle yet
Shall I do? I can never say my loneliness
Every Heart doesn't know
so what to say oh what to do
(I) was afraid of darkness
cause I felt that I was left alone
So I prayed for help to
(the) distant million stars

Round & Round the planets
revolve round the sun
And we always seek after love and peace
Forever more
Growing growing woe baby we can work it out
Look up at the sky
Every Heart is shining all today

Show me now What kind of smile do I come across
Every Heart Every Heart can take a step towards the dreams
All of us what to take a lasting happiness
Whenever you feel sad

I wanna hold you & give you a sound sleep
Someday Every Heart gonna free and easy
We have peace of mind
Someday all the people find the way to love

Goes & Goes the time goes on we are not alone
We live on together and we will find some precious things
Sometime we will smile sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believing yourself-
Tomorrow's never die

There is the warm heart places on my mind
In my earlist day's there and it's so sweet
There are many stars they have talk with me so kind
They say yes always time's a friend of mine so shine

Round & Round the planets
revolve round the sun
And we always seek after love and peace
Forever more
Growing growing woe baby we can work it out
Look up at the sky
Every Heart is shining all today

Goes & Goes the time goes on we are not alone
We live on together and we will find some precious things
Sometime we will smile sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believing yourself-
Tomorrow's never die

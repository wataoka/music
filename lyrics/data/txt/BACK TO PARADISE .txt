All alone here in no man's land
Get a devil walkin' right beside me
Angel come and take me by the hand
Take me to a place far behind me

Paradise
I just wanna go back
Where I belong
Paradise
Back to paradise

Get a dream that calls in the night
Got a feelin' keeps growin' stronger
Gotta hold on till the time is right
Don't know if I can want much longer

Paradise
Keep on callin' me back
Where I belong
Paradise
Back to paradise forever

I gotta fly like the wind
I gotta cry like a wounded eagle
Goin' back to paradise
Got a long long way to go
I gotta race with the tide
I gotta face every kind of danger
Goin' back to paradise
Running all the way back home

There's a battle I should have won
Words of wisdom I should have spoken
Gotta right the wrongs I have done
Gotta mend the hearts I have broken

Paradise
Will I ever get back
Where I belong
Paradise
Back to paradise forever

I gotta fly like the wind
I gotta cry like a wounded eagle
Goin' back to paradise
Got a long long way to go

You never know a good thing
Till it's gone away
You never know where home is
Till you're far away, far away

I gotta fly like the wind
I gotta cry like a wounded eagle
Goin' back to paradise
Got a long long way to go
I gotta race with the tide
I gotta face every kind of danger
Goin' back to paradise
Running all the way back home

I gotta fly like the wind
I gotta cry like a wounded eagle
Goin' back to paradise
Got a long long way to go
I gotta race with the tide
I gotta face every kind of danger
Goin' back to paradise
Running all the way back home

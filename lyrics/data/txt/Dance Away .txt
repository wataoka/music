Lights flahing in the dark
Colors bursting like fireworks
It's getting louder, louder and stronger
Feel the music take control

Spotlights chasing every move
This is the moment of our lives
Heartbeat's getting faster
Can't wait any longer
Better get ready 'cause we're 'bout to lose control

dance control
take the roll
kick away the wall
lets make it over, party show

Some times so nice and slow

Are you ready for hit the floor hit the floor

See it Feel it Make it
Move it! Shake it Take it
Join to our party our party our party
Lets get this party started Music is gets started

Each and every step I take
Takes me higher into the sky
It's like I'm flying, way past the star lights
To a place I never knew

Now's the time to make a move
Gon' rock my body to the beat
We came here to give you
A show of a life time
People get ready 'cause you're about to be surprised

Like a very smiley very smiley very smiley

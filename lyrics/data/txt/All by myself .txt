The season's passing by,
You've left is all behind,
And everything was so wonderful.
In all the things we've done,
Our memories will go on,
And it's gonna be wonderful.

We're back here on the shore,
Couldn't ask for nothing more,
You know it's gonna be quite alright.
Look back on the days,
The tide breaks on your legs,
New memories start tonight.

On and on we go living the life on the speedway,
Knowing not where to go, Knowing not if it's gonna be alright,
I know and now I know this is the life I was made for,
I don't know if it shows, but this is the way I'm gonna live my life.

Come on everybody let's get up and start it,
If you wanna party don't forget to call me.
Come on everybody tell me that you need me,
Sometimes, I fear I'm dreaming all by myself.

The sparkle in his eye,
Claims to tell you no lies,
Cause everything is so wonderful.
And nobody knows what's on his mind,
If you ask him he says he's fine,
He thinks that everything's worderful.

With his head up high,
He walks a narrow line,
He knows it's gonna be quite alright,
Look back on the days,
They seem so far away,
Nobody's gonna take away tonight.

On and on he goes livin' the life that he used to,
Knowing not where to go, knowing not if it's gonna be alright,
He knows and now he knows, this is the life he was made for,
I don't know if it shows, but this is the way he's gonna live his life.

Come on everybody let's get up and start it,
If you wanna party don't forget to call me.
Come on everybody tell me that you need me,
Sometimes, I fear I'm dreaming all by myself.

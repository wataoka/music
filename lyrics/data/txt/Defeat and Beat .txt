What is it that really matters the most
Family, love relationships, and friendship?
What's the dream you've carried since you were little
Well, the solution isn't really important
You have never been honest
So now it is time for you to think hard

Beating
Life is not easy.
There's so much to deal with
Living the way you want is always hard
because not all people will accept you as (the) way you are

It's hard to not fake
Don't wear that mask
You can't get it off
Once you've putted on
All your thoughts
Astray
We hesitate to choose our answer

If it isn't the honest side of you, it has no means at all
ここから抜け出そうよ

No need for you to fake what you carry
Lying is nothing but (a) waste
Say goodbye to yourself you hate
心のありか 探して

Faking is a crime

It is sometime hard to believe in all the truth
You will hate yourself
You will lose confidence and will lose yourself and your hope

思い描いた未来が欲しいのなら
散らばる欠片を集めて進め

Please do not kill your mind (and) true self
Always stay as who you are and don't waste yourself
最後に選ぶのは君だ

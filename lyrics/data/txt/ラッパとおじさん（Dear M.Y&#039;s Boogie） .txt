I believe, I believe,
I believe in Mr.Yagi
Everynight, everynight, everynight
He let me play some boogie
When all my friends put me down
He can always treat me right again

I've been trying,
I've been trying,
I've been trying
Just to say“I thank you”

Oh my lord, oh my lord, lord have mercy
On the way he do
I didn't have nobody
just to talk about my troubles to

I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore, more, more

Yes, everybody,
I'm not alone woo baby, what's goin' on
Listen to me, he is nice,
Because everything is alright now

He does more for me than anyone ever done before
I've never known this kind of man
Who's very splendid every times, you know
To see him is to love him
Because he plays just like Quincy Jones!

I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore, more, more

Yes, everybody,
I'm not alone woo baby, what's goin' on
Listen to me, he is nice,
Because everything is alright now

I believe, I believe,
I believe in Mr.Yagi
Everynight, everynight, everynight
He let me play some boogie
When all my friends put me down
He can always treat me right again

I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore,
I don't cry anymore, more, more

Yes, everybody,
I'm not alone woo baby, what's goin' on
Listen to me, he is nice,
Because everything is alright now

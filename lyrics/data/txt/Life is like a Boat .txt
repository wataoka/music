Nobody knows who I really am
I never felt this empty before
And if I ever need someone to come along
Who's gonna comfort me, and keep me strong
We are all rowing the boat of fate
The waves keep on comin' and we can't escape
But if we ever get lost on your way
The waves would guide you thru another day
遠くで息をしてる 透明になったみたい
暗闇に思えたけど 目隠しされてただけ
祈りをささげて 新しい日を待つ
鮮やかに 光る海 その果てまで

Nobody knows who I really am
Maybe they just don't give a damn
But if I ever need someone to come along
I know you would follow me, and keep me strong
人の心はうつりゆく 抜け出したくなる
つきはまた新しい周期で 舟を連れてく

And every time I see your face,
the oceans heave up to my heart
You make me wanna strain at the oars,
and soon I can see the shore

I want you to know who I really am
I never though I'd feel this way towards you
And if you ever need someone to come along
I will follow you, and keep you strong
旅はまだ続いてく 穏やかな日も
つきはまた新しい周期で 舟を照らし出す
祈りをささげて 新しい日を待つ
鮮やかに 光る海 その果てまで

And every time I see your face,
the oceans heave up to my heart
You make me wanna strain at the oars,
and soon I can see the shore

運命の船を漕ぎ 波は次から次へと私たちを襲うけど
それも素敵な旅ね どれも素敵な旅ね

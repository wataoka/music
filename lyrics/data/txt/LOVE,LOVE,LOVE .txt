I never was the kind of guy
Who thought that love could make me cry
I found out the hard way, I was wrong.
I thought I was the only one
But now I'm just a lonely one
How could I have known what's going on.
I'm telling you that love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you.
I'm telling you that love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you.
I never thought I'd live to see
The day you turn your back on me
I don't understand where we went wrong.
You had me filled with all your life
And now the tears are in my eyes
How could I have known what's going on.
I'm telling you that love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you.

I'm telling you that love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you.
I'm telling you that love, love, love Love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you. (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I'm telling you that love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you.
I'm telling you that love, love, love
Can make such a fool of you.
I'm telling you that. (Love, love, love・・・・・・)
I've been told before, it's true
Love can make such a fool of you.
I've been told before, it's true
Love can make such a fool of you.

I still remember the sun light staring back of us
And painting our shadows on the green grass of runway
I have noticed the air ship holding our gaze
The time has synchronized

重ね合う指はそこに在ることを
繰り返す呼吸は変わり行くことを
確かめ合おう 傷つけ合っても

The clear sky weeps sincerely
I don't stay in my past
It's time to say my last farewell to your ship
君が流す涙は枯れた心を伝う

Toneless Twilight
Toneless Highlight
手に届かない明日へ

I still remember the moon light staring back of us
And painting our shadows on the white snow of rail track
罪のない光 救いのない陰

The deep sea smiles silently
You're not mired in your past
It's time to say your last farewell to my train
君が唄う言葉は冷えた空気を伝う

Toneless Twilight
Toneless Highlight
手に届かせる明日を
届けたい
君に会いたい
Toneless Highlight

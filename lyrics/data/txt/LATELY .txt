Lately I have had this strangest feeling
with no vivid reason here to find.
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging, 'round my mind.
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
with, you say, no special place to go.
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
you don't know, never know.

Well, I'm a man of many wishes,
hope my premonition misses,
but what I really feel, my eyes won't let me hide,
'cause they always start to cry.
'cause this time could mean goodbye.

Lately I've been staring in the mirror,
Very slowly picking me apart;
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart.
Just the other night while you were sleeping,
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name.
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping,
You just say nothing's changed.

Well, I'm a man of many wishes,
hope my premonition misses,
but what I really feel, my eyes won't let me hide,
'cause they always start to cry.
'cause this time could mean goodbye.

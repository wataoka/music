We were walking
Round the station
All them beautiful lights
We were dancing and Romancing
What a beautiful sight
Tell we why, Are we running around people always see the same things
that we just let on by, so I take it down a notch and ya tell me...
Is it all for everyone Because all the things you say to me
they mean so much to you and me
We were talking about the Future.
I wonder How it could be
And we were singing oooh! oooh!
Round that corner
what a wonderful night
So tell we why are we running around
everybody knows that this is...the place is...
where we both belong So we bring up a notch and ya tell me,
that its all for everyone
How long is it gonna take before we celebrate our lives...
How long is it gonna take before we make it all worth while
And what can we do
Let's take our time, write it all down until we figure out the tune.

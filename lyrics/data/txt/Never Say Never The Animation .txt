Reality slips far away
Fiction comes alive as we start to play
Hope is no more behind a closed door
As we drift away from what was once before
Hope and hopelessness become one
It's all meaningless we've already begun
We are all one in the same
Never opposites when we play the same game

We walk a thin line between hope and despair
Running from the truth but it's already here
Told so many lies I don't know if they can find me
Only one life to live so choose wisely
Heads or tails?
Do you know what side you're on?
Does it even matter if it's on the same coin?
If you wanna achieve you gotta believe
The time is right now there's the door here's the keys

Just gotta chase the pain away
Let it fade away
There's a ray of hope beyond despair
Move on-Look for the truth in this world
Break through the confusion
Find a solution
Beat the twisted evil things
Just do it, go for it

Never say never
Never say never
Never say never

Break through the confusion
Find a solution
Beat the twisted evil things
Just do it, go for it

Never

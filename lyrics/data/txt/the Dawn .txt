I got to get it, got to get it into my spirit,
I feel my body is moonlit.
That's only my benefit.
I know what I want is the Force.

I got to knockity-knock, got to zap into my soul.
It's the oversoul,
I will meet and I got to ensoul.
For all, what I need is the Force.

I wonder how I grab the Force as my own.
I will find a way.
Focus my attention to continue.
I got to get my own Force.
I just go on.

I say, I am ready to go for it with my desperation.
What makes me tick?
I believe in my quiet inspiration.
Sometimes, I follow after my silent imagination.
Let the process take me where it will.
I got to do!

Can I let my wandering thoughts come and go,
Watch them passing by?
I don't attempt to change or control them.
I try to see how I can be.
I am myself.

I say, I am ready to go for it with my desperation.
What makes me tick?

Let the process take me where it will.
I got to do!

So now, I wanna walk calmly even in the wind ahead.

And then, there can be helpful signs from my predestination.
So why, I won't stop even there is my Waterloo ahead.
I see, there must be the way to lead to my confirmation.
Be alert, stand firm to myself.

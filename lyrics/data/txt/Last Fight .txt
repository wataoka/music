you're messing with the king
I am the king of kings
stop fall king with me
all of y'all hypocrites you better stop faking your shit
I think you're testing my nerve kid
nothing gonna change
pain becomes my game
it's something to play
you gonna love my name
cuz I am the ruler of this motherfucking place
it's all the same
bad and the good
together they are one
in any neighborhood
think twice you know you should

mr.president, its a coup d'etat and I am the next rule
got nothing to choose
ride or die that's how I move
in a sec, I'll wipe out the mood
so let me drop this bomb, BOOM!!it's over!

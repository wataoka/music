I'm riding a flower in green

Fading colors
We're out of time
You have to believe me now you see that I'm

Ready for it
When they arrive
Now come take my hand together we'll survive

Night is falling
Like yesterday
An arrow is flying through the empty sky

They will know
That we are alive

We're coming for you like a shooting star
And when the light is fading you will know, who we are

I'm riding a flower in green
Come fly on a rainbow with me
I am on my way
Maybe I look young to you
But when I'm in here I'm a queen

The sky is changing
To black and blue
We're holding our guard up in unity

Don't know whats coming
Don't know whats true
If everyone wants to live in harmony
Find a friend
Love their family
And to stay alive

I'm coming to you like a shooting star
But can we ever really know for sure, who we are

I'm riding a flower in green
Come fly on a rainbow with me
I am on my way
Maybe I look young to you
But I'm not your regular teen

I'm flying a flower in green
My friend in a bluey marine
We are on our way
Three of us together now
We're shining like you've never seen

Invincible dreams
20.000 years of slumber
Awakened by men
Trying to bend to their way
They'll never take our hope away
(When me and my friends stand between)

I'm riding a flower in green
Come fly on a rainbow with me
We are on our way
All of us together now
We're shining like you've never seen

We are on our way
All of us together now
We're shining like you've never seen

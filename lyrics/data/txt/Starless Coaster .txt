friendly waters
bloody flowers
sleepy kisses
tell me story
Kill me softly

nameless actor
loveless monster
starless coaster
Hear me earnestly
Forget me eternally

Your eyes radiate as the stars
My eyes reflect as the planets
Your life is a movie
My music is the soundtrack
I wish I could sing in tune
still the wish in my heart

Tell me story
Hear me earnestly
Kill me softly
Forget me eternally

Yesterday you cried in small room alone
Today I knocked on the door of your heart
I told you that world is awesome you know?
Come join us, and shake my hands firmly

It's so easy to start walking I know
Cause you can go anywhere on your feet
Your fears, your tears, and your dreams belong to you
No need to deny because we are only human

It's so easy to start talking I know
Cause we have a mouth and there are many words
My fears, my tears, and my dreams belong to me
I just want to let you know I just want to talk with you
This is my wish

Yesterday you cried in small room alone
Today I knocked on the door of your heart
I told you that life is too short you know?
Come join us, and shake my hands firmly

It's so easy to start walking I know
Cause you can go anywhere on your feet
Your fears, your tears, and your dreams belong to you
No need to deny because we are only human

It's so easy to start talking I know
Cause we have a mouth and there are many words
My fears, my tears, and my dreams belong to me
I just want to let you know I just want to talk with you
This is my wish

I just want to talk with you
This is my wish

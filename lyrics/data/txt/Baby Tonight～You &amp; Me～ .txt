Baby tonight I'll be the one here in your arms
暖かく包む Yes, I'll give you my life
I would do anything You're in my life

You, You hold on to me through this life
Tell me 恋におちた
全て chance and 後は right
Tell me now 君の想い

Give it to me 優しい
Tell me again 言葉を
Give me a time
Show me the way
Just あなただけ

Baby tonight
I'll be the one here in your arms
So close your eyes and hold me tight
そして I wish we could just stay forever this way
You ＆ Me

Baby tonight I'll be the one here in your arms
想い続けてる Yes, I'll give you my life
I would do anything You're in my life

You, You hold on to me through this life
Tell me 目覚めさせた
いつも chance and きっと right
Tell me now 全てはキミ

Give it to me いつかは
Tell me again 待ってる
Give me a time
Show me the way
Justこの気持ち

Baby tonight
I'll be the one here in your arms
So close your eyes and hold me tight
そして I wish we could just stay forever this way
You ＆ Me

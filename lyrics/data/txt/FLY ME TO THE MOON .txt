Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what Spring is like 
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand!
In other words, daring, kiss me!

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what Spring is like 
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand!
In other words, daring, kiss me!

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

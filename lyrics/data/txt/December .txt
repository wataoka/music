Always, Always in my life
I couldn't see, or wouldn't see all the things
That I needed then
Can I try again?
With One broken wing
I lay there in darkness

Suddenly, So suddenly you were sent
To help me feel again
Say it's just a game
It took some time
To realize oh
If only I knew your love
Maybe you'd still be here by my side...

You fixed up my wings
So I could fly again
But I stand alone now
Wonder why I let you go

I wanna hold you once again
Even though you're gone
Even more now you're gone
Now that we're further
Wish I'd tried a little harder
What goes around comes around
And I'm always a little too late...

oh oh

Lonely, This feeling I can't described
Still I cry
As I try to find the words
To make you see that I,
I can change I'll try
If only you'll give me
Just one more chance baby

Slowly, so slowly in my heart
Memories are flying
Your face as You were leaving
I didn't know how to Love
I couldn't see hope above
Nothing can change the past
But Please let me make right a wrong

I'll fly like a bird again
Break away my leash yeah
I'll Spread these wings
I won't let the rain fall down

I wanna feel you once again
Even just for a while
Even just for a day
Let me remember
That day in December
Dusty old fairy tale
Now long gone old memory

Even though you feel desperate for love
Even though you wanna scream your fears out
And there'll be times you,
You want it to end
But you write your own story
You can change this all around
Wow wow

I wanna hold you once again
Even though you're gone
Even more now you're gone
Now that we're further
Wish I'd tried a little harder
What goes around comes around
And I'm always a little too late...

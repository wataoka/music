交わる時間上にない涙腺曲がる快楽
吐き捨てる哀・怒を手に妬みとつないでる
映り気にしてる程見えない相違
価値観の連鎖を止めるフリー気取りの×

gravity-wall 口づけを

I'm screaming something to you. Whatever, something to me
ズレた答えをどけた先だけが
I'm screaming something to you. Whatever, something to me
絡まってる裸足でも賭ける

Now I don't know what I really want
I still don't know how to escape from this beautiful trap
Don't know what I really want
I still don't know how to escape from this dangerous trap

無駄な理想像描き反響探し解読
取って付ける成功法に飾る未来が倒れる
日に当たらせるほど焦げた正義
キリない損得外せば手に取れた声

I know you're craving for my blood

I'm screaming something to you. Whatever, something to me
But everybody can't hear. Pay attention to me！
I'm screaming something to you. Whatever, something to me
Everybody can't hear. Pay attention to me！

Now I don't know what I really want
I still don't know how to escape from this beautiful trap
Don't know what I really want
I still don't know how to escape from this dangerous trap

I'm screaming something to you. Whatever, something to me
ズレた答えをどけた先だけが
I'm screaming something to you. Whatever, something to me
絡まってる裸足でも賭ける

Now I don't know what I really want
I still don't know how to escape from this beautiful trap
Don't know what I really want
I still don't know how to escape from this dangerous trap

Break your stereo days
空ほどいた太陽と羽の白が
Brave invisible world
無くした色たちを照らす

Break your stereo days
Whatever they say, you'll never stop to believe in yourself
Brave invisible world
You know that it's true. You can find the new way

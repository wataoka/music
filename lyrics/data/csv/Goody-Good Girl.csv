What a good girl would never do X4

視線絡ませignite
見つめてhypnotize
痺れるほどcan't deny
Got you feelin' quite alright

I won't be askin' permission
I know your daddy would never approve
Your body be spinnin' and twistin'
I'll make my move

Think you're a good girl, Goody good girl
But that ain't true
Won't be a good girl, Goody good girl
when I'm done with you
ためらう理性をキスで惑わせて
You'll do what good girl, Goody good girls won't do

汗ばむ肌はslip slide
鼓動がoverdrive
見せてよ もっと don't hide
Somethin' burnin' deep inside

I won't be askin' permission
I know your daddy would never approve
Your body be spinnin' and twistin'
I'll make my move

Think you're a good girl, Goody good girl
But that ain't true
Won't be a good girl, Goody good girl
when I'm done with you
甘く罪深い秘密を分け合って
You'll do what good girl, Goody good girls won't do

They call me Casanova
you should know the rumors are true
You'll do what good girl, Goody good girls won't do

回る Everyday 全て忘れAlright
感じるまま 楽しんだら Tonight

Think you're a good girl, Goody good girl
But that ain't true
Won't be a good girl, Goody good girl
when I'm done with you
They call me Casanova
you should know the rumors are true
You'll do what good girl, Goody good girls won't do

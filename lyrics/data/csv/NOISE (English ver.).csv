Never say good-bye, but keep me by your side
""Everything's all right"" is not all right
""That is enough"" will never be enough
Just say you like me and everything of mine

I know you make me happy but I won't feel it enough
I'm greedy I want everything from you
If I dare to say it, will you leave me?
I'm sitting next to you and I keep silent

Why can't you see my heart?
Why I can't see your heart?
Find my feelings behind my words
""Leave me alone"" is ""Stay with me""
I hate you, I love you
If we can't change anything

What a beautiful world, when I was a little girl
White horse, kind knight, sweet, tender dreams
Everything is wrong and wrong things are right
""This is something we want, we call it happiness""
I don't want it anymore, no, no, no, no, no

Take on worries, you never ask my help
I can't do anything but I want to be your strength
Always thinking how I could be
Someone you need but I never know how

We repeat same thing
You hurt me, I hurt you
Hurting each other, now who is crying?
Forgiving everything? Forgetting everything?
Scars, tears
And I?

Don't say good-bye, but keep me by your side
""Everything's all right"" is not all right
""That is enough"" will never be enough
If you don't like me and anything of mine

What we want to say is lost in the noise
I cannot hear your voice, you can't hear my voice
""Stay with me"" just simple words to say
I've wanted to become the one that you need
I can't say it anymore no, no, no, no, no

I can't say it anymore no, no, no, no, no

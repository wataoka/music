Time is passing as we're speaking
So what are we waiting for tonight?

We're getting closer I can feel it
It's so far, yet so close
They say time is only for the living
We take it for granted and run out the clock without a reason

さぁ Let's find a place that only we know
もう Forget about the past and come with me

Believe that oh we are dreamers
Oh we are free to be anything
The world is changing and the clock is ticking
It's only just a matter of time before the end
But we are dreamers
Oh we are free to be anything
It doesn't matter how far, no matter where you are
The race called ""Life"" just begun
And I'll be there next to you until the end

さぁ Let's find a place that only we know
もう Forget about the past and come with me
あぁ I know it's hard to change the way we are
そう The future waits for us to make it bright

Believe that oh we are dreamers
Oh we are free to be anything
The world is changing and the clock is ticking
It's only just a matter of time before the end
But we are dreamers
Oh we are free to be anything
It doesn't matter how far, no matter where you are
The race called ""Life"" just begun
And I'll be there next to you until the end

時が流れても 季節が巡っても
負けないで欲しい 諦めないでくれ
夢見るあなたはどうか変わらずに
暗闇を抜けて時を越えて行こう
